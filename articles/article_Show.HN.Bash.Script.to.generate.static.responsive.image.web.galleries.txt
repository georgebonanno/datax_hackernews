      gallery.sh

Bash Script to generate static web galleries. No server-side programs (i.e. PHP, MySQL) required.

Overview

gallery.sh is simple bash shell script which generates static html thumbnail (image, photo) galleries using the convert and jhead command-line utilities.
It requires no special server-side script to run to view image galleries because everything is pre-rendered. 
It offers several features:

Responsive layout
Thumbnails which fill the browser efficiently
Download the original image file
Nice and simple Bootstrap CSS layout
Locally previewable galleries by accessing images locally (e.g. file:///home/nils/pics/gallery/index.html)
JPEG header EXIF data extraction
Auto-rotation of veritcal images
This combination of features makes a better user experience than pretty much all the big online photo hosts. 
All you need is a place to host your plain html and jpeg files. This can also be Amazon S3.

Requirements

ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) for the convert utility.
JHead (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/) for EXIF data extraction
On a debian-based system (Ubuntu), just run apt-get install imagemagick jhead as root.

Under macOS you can install it with MacPort (https://www.macports.org/): sudo port install imagemagick jhead

Usage

gallery.sh [-t <title>] [-h]


gallery.sh works in the current directory.  Just load the index.html in a browser see the output. 

The directory should contain a bunch of JPEG (.jpg or .JPG) files. It does not work recursively. 
ZIP files (.zip or .ZIP) and movies (.mov, .MOV, .mp4 or .MP4) are also considered. They appear as a download button in the gallery.
