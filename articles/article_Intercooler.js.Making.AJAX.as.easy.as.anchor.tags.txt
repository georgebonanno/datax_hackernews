Introduction

Intercooler is a small (6.74KB gzipped) jQuery-based library that allows you to add AJAX to your application using
HTML attributes.

Here is an example:

    <!-- When this button is clicked an AJAX POST request is sent to /example and the 
         response content is swapped in to the body of the button -->
    <button ic-post-to="/example">
        Click Me!
    </button>

Despite this simplicity, intercooler supports quite a bit of functionality:

It allows you to specify the UI event that triggers the AJAX request
It makes progress indicators very simple to add
It supports many custom HTTP response headers for things like client-side redirection
It has a REST-ful dependency mechanism
It has simple AJAX history & back-button support
It provides a rich event model
And much more...
These features allow you to build modern web applications with little fuss, using a simple and intuitive REST-ful architecture that ensures good performance, excellent user experience and a minimum of complexity.

It also is very easy to incrementally retrofit intercooler into existing web applications to add AJAX functionality where
it is most valuable.

Full documentation is available on the main intercooler website

Installing

Intercooler can be downloaded or hot-linked from the downloads page.

Or installed via bower:

    "intercooler-js" : "1.0.2"

Contributing

To contribute a change to intercooler:

Fork the main intercooler repository
Create a new feature branch based on the development branch with a reasonably descriptive name (e.g. fix_http_get_parameter_overriding)
Implement your fix
Add a test to /test/unit_tests.html.  (It's pretty easy!)
Create a pull request for that branch against development in the main repository
Thank you to all the contributors!
