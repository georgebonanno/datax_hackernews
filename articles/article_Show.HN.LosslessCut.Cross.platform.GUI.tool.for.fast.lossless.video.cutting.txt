      LosslessCut üé•

Simple, cross platform video editor for lossless trimming / cutting of videos. Great for rough processing of large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. Lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard GB of data without losing quality. It doesn't do any decoding / encoding and is therefore extremely fast. Also allows for taking JPEG snapshots of the video at the selected time. This app uses the awesome ffmpegüôè for doing the grunt work. Also supports lossless cutting in the most common audio formats.

ffmpeg is now included in the app! üéâ



Installing / running

Download latest LosslessCut from releases
Run LosslessCut app/exe
Documentation

Supported platforms

Mac OS X
Windows (64/32bit)
Linux (64/32bit, not tested)
Supported formats

Since LosslessCut is based on Chromium and uses the HTML5 video player, not all ffmpeg supported formats will be supported.
The following formats/codecs should generally work: MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, OGG, WAV, MP3, AAC, H264, Theora, VP8, VP9
For more information about supported formats / codecs, see https://www.chromium.org/audio-video.

Typical flow

Drag drop a video file into player to load or use ‚åò/CTRL+O.
Press SPACE to play/pause
Select the cut start and end time
Press the scissors button to export the slice
Press the camera button to take a snapshot
The original video files will not be modified. Instead it creates a lossless export in the same directory as the original file with from/to timestamps. Note that the cut is currently not precise around the cutpoints, so video before/after the nearest keyframe will be lost. EXIF data is preserved.

Keyboard shortcuts

SPACE, k Play/pause
j Slow down video
l Speed up video
‚Üê Seek backward 1 sec
‚Üí Seek forward 1 sec
. (period) Tiny seek forward
, (comma) Tiny seek backward
i Mark in / cut start point
o Mark out / cut end point
e Export selection (in the same dir as the video)
c Capture snapshot (in the same dir as the video)
Development building / running
