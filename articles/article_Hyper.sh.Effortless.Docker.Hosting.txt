            THE CLOUD
            THAT WORKS LIKE
            ONE SINGLE MACHINE
          
          
            
              
                "OPS-LESS"
                The entire Hyper.sh cloud works as a single server with infinite resources and always available. There is no VM node, cluster, or scheduler to manage. The workflow is simply:
                
                hyper pull nginx
                  hyper run nginx
                
            
            
              
                5-SECOND PROVISIONING
                Pull your Docker image from Docker Hub, private registry, or even from S3, then hyper run to launch it. Your container will be live in 5 seconds!
              
            
            
              
                PER SECOND BILLING
                Forget about the expensive hourly rates. Hyper.sh uses a per-second billing model, which allows you to launch a new container in 5 seconds, run for 30s, shutdown in 1s. Pay as little as 5+30+1=36 seconds!
              
            
            
              
                MICRO INSTANCE (64MB)
                Breakdown your monolithic application into micro-services with Hyper.sh's micro containers (64MB mem). They are agile, efficient, and cost effective!
              
            
          
        
        
          
            EVERYTHING YOU WANT,
            NATIVELY ON CONTAINER
          
          
            
              
                EBS-LIKE PERSISTENT VOLUME
                Your containers are attached with EBS-like volumes. The data is automatically replicated, distributed and protected from failures. Moreover, you can create snapshots for backup/restore.
              
            
            
              
                L2 PRIVATE NETWORK
                Your containers will run in your own Layer-2 network. Your traffic is completely isolated from other users and the rest of the world!
