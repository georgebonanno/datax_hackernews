        (updated version, with 20 new systems)

JSCity is an implementation of the Code City metaphor for visualizing source code. We adapted and implemented this metaphor for JavaScript, using the 
three.js 3D library.

JSCity represents a JavaScript program as a city, as follows:

Folders are districts and files are sub-districts

Functions are buildings; inner functions are represented as buildings on the top of their nested function/building. 
The Number Of Lines of Source (LOC) represents the height of the buildings/functions; the Number Of Variables (NOV) in a function correlates to the building's base size. Blue buildings denote named functions; green buildings are anonymous functions.


Examples
