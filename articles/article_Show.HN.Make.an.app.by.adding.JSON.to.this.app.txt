Jasonette

https://www.jasonette.com

Create your own native iOS app with nothing but JSON. Then send it over the Internet.

â˜… Jasonette fetches this JSON markup from a server:



â˜… And self-constructs into the following native app, in realtime:





Cool things about Jasonette

100% NATIVE: Jasonette maps JSON into native components and native function calls. There is no gimmick. There is no magic.
App loads over HTTP: Your app exists 100% as JSON, and loads from the cloud. No more hard-coding.
An app in 30 minutes: No kidding, build an app in 30 minutes.
Lowest possible learning curve: No programming experience required. There's only one thing you need to know: JSON. Which means you can build an app without "becoming a programmer".


Quickstart

Visit the website to get started.



Download

Latest release: ver0.1.0



More Examples

Try playing these on Jasonette and watch them turn into native apps in front of your eyes!

Jasonpedia Tutorial demo app that includes all Jasonette feature implementations.
Instagram An Instagram UI, 100% powered by JSON.
Twitter A Twitter UI, 100% powered by JSON.


Technical Highlights

1. One JSON to rule them all

Jasonette simplifies the entire app building process down to nothing more than:

Write a JSON markup
Add the JSON url to Jasonette
Press play
This is possible because Jasonette came up with a way to fit an entire app worth of logic into a single declarative JSON that just worksâ„¢. This JSON grammar is used to express every aspect of your app, such as:

Draw sophisticated views
Call device API methods
Chain method calls to perform complex logic
Respond to system events and user interaction
Even change the JSON itself dynamically using templates.


2. App-over-HTTP

Until now, the only thing JSON could send over the Internet was raw data. Normally apps would fetch remote data from the server for a connected experience, but the actual app logic would be hard-coded on the client side. This makes it hard to update and extend apps.

But what happens when you can express an entire app logic as JSON?

Then apps can be stored, processed, shared, and sent over the Internet just like any other JSON. Watch below where we update the JSON on a JSON pastebin server, and the app changes immediately to reflect the new markup:





3. Designed to be extended or integrated

Currently Jasonette covers all the essential native APIs and components, which means you can build pretty much any app you can imagine. But Jasonette is very flexible.

A. Extensible

If you don't see a feature you want, you can simply extend Jasonette. If it's useful for the general public, we can even merge it into the core.

B. Integrate existing code

You can even integrate Jasonette with your existing iOS project if you want. This way you can use Jasonette for just a small part of your app without having to completely switch to a new way of programming.
