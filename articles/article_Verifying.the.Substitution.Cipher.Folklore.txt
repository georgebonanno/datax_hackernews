	2016.03.18Verifying the Substitution Cipher Folklore

A substitution cipher has each letter substituted with another.
Cryptography folklore has it that simple substitution ciphers
are trivial
to break by looking at the letter frequencies of the encrypted text.
I tested the folklore and the results were not quite what I was expecting.



Here is a series of examples I prepared for a course on the use of Unix
command-line tools.

Encryption

Bob fetches a copy of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice
and encrypts it with a rot13 cipher.
(Each letter is substituted with the one 13 places after it.)

curl -L http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342.txt.utf-8 >pride-and-prejudice.txt
tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]' <pride-and-prejudice.txt >secret

Derived Frequency Tables

Alice, faced with the secret text, creates a function that
creates a string of letters based on the frequency of their
occurrence.
This can then be readily passed to the Unix tr program.

freqlist()
{
  # Add a newline after each character
  sed 's/./&\
/g' |
  sort |
  uniq -c |  # Count number of occurrences
  sort -rn | # Order by frequency
  # Output letters in order of frequency
  awk 'BEGIN { ORS = ""} /[A-Za-z]/ { print $2 }'
}
echo bbbooooa | freqlist


oba


Decryption Using the Frequency Tables

Alice, then fetches a copy of
Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov
and uses its frequency table to decrypt the secret file.

curl -L http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28054/28054-0.txt >karamazov.txt
tr $(freqlist <secret) $(freqlist <karamazov.txt) <secret | head -40

Given the size of the two volumes' text, I was expecting that this
would yield an almost perfect result.
In fact, the result still needs significant guesswork to decrypt.

Analysis
We can see what's behind this problem by juxtaposing  the frequency tables
of the two original texts.
freqtable()
{
  # Add a newline after each character
  sed 's/./&\
/g' |
  sort |
  uniq -c |  # Count number of occurrences
  sort -rn   # Order by frequency
}
paste <(freqtable <pride-and-prejudice.txt) <(freqtable <karamazov.txt) |
head -26

   8249 b	  21469 p
   6396 .	  19873 b
   5811 v	  18626 v
   3553 "	  12940 k


As you can see, the first two rows match the picture given in
cryptology texts: the most frequent letters are indeed e and then t.
However,
then things get messier: o and a are swapped, as are h and i and r and s.
Jane Austen's book contains 124 thousand words and yet a simple
frequency analysis did not yield a good-enough decryption.
Decrypting a message of only a few lines would be even more difficult.
The moral of the story is that, contrary to what's often claimed
in cryptology books, decrypting a simple substitution cipher
may be easy but it's definitely not trivial.
