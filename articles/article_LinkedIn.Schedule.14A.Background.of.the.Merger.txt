LinkedIn Corporation
2029 Stierlin Court
Mountain View, CA 94043
 
[·], 2016
 
Dear LinkedIn Stockholder:
 
You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders, which we refer to as the special meeting, of LinkedIn Corporation to be held on [·], 2016, at the Computer History Museum, 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View, CA 94043, at [·], Pacific time.
 
At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 11, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the merger agreement, by and among LinkedIn, Microsoft Corporation, which we refer to as Microsoft, and Liberty Merger Sub Inc.  We refer to the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft as the merger.  At the special meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to its named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $196.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, which we refer to collectively as the common stock, that you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a premium of approximately 49.5% over the closing price of LinkedIns Class A common stock on June 10, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement.
 
LinkedIns Board of Directors, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on and subject to the conditions set forth therein, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of LinkedIn and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in all respects.
 
LinkedIns Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) FOR the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, which we refer to collectively as the proposals.
 
The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger.  A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.
 
This proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of LinkedIns Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger.  We encourage you to read this proxy statement and its annexes, including the merger agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important information.

SUMMARY
 
This summary highlights selected information from this   proxy statement related to the merger of Liberty Merger Sub Inc. (a wholly   owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation) with and into LinkedIn   Corporation, which we refer to as the merger, and may not contain all of   the information that is important to you.    To understand the merger more fully and for a more complete   description of the legal terms of the merger, you should carefully read this   entire proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents   that we refer to in this proxy statement.    You may obtain the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange   Commission, which we refer to as the SEC, without charge by following the   instructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned Where You Can   Find More Information.  The merger   agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.  We encourage you to read the merger   agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, carefully and   in its entirety.
 
Except as otherwise specifically noted in this proxy   statement, LinkedIn, we, our, us and similar words refer to LinkedIn   Corporation, including, in certain cases, our subsidiaries.  Throughout this proxy statement, we refer   to Microsoft Corporation as Microsoft and Liberty Merger Sub Inc. as   Merger Sub.  In addition, throughout   this proxy statement we refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as   of June 11, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time, by and among   LinkedIn, Microsoft and Merger Sub as the merger agreement.
 
Parties Involved in the Merger
 
LinkedIn Corporation
 
LinkedIn   is the worlds largest professional network on the internet with over 433   million members in over 200 countries and territories as of the date of this   proxy statement. Members use our platform to stay connected and informed,   advance their career and work smarter.

Microsoft Corporation
 
Microsoft   is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every   organization on the planet to achieve more. Its strategy is to build   best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first,   cloud-first world.  Founded in 1975,   Microsoft operates worldwide and has offices in more than 100 countries.

Effect of the Merger
 
Upon   the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub   will merge with and into LinkedIn, with LinkedIn continuing as the surviving   corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.  Throughout this proxy statement, we use the   term surviving corporation to refer to LinkedIn as the surviving   corporation following the merger.  As a   result of the merger, LinkedIn will cease to be a publicly traded   company.  If the merger is completed,   you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving   corporation.
 
The   time at which the merger becomes effective, which we refer to as the   effective time of the merger, will occur upon the filing of a certificate   of merger with and acceptance of such certificate by the Secretary of State   of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as LinkedIn, Microsoft and   Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).
 
Effect on LinkedIn if the Merger is Not   Completed
 
If   the merger agreement is not adopted by LinkedIn stockholders or if the merger   is not completed for any other reason, LinkedIn stockholders will not receive   any payment for their shares of Class A common stock and Class B   common stock, which we refer to collectively as the common stock.  Instead, LinkedIn will remain an   independent public company, our Class A common stock will continue to be   listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange   Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, and we will   continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.  Under specified circumstances, LinkedIn   will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee upon the termination of   the merger agreement.  For more   information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger   AgreementTermination Fee.
 
Merger Consideration
 
In   the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares held by   (1) LinkedIn as treasury stock; (2) Microsoft, Merger Sub or their   respective subsidiaries; and (3) LinkedIn stockholders who have properly   and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law   with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and converted into the right   to receive $196.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding   taxes, which amount we refer to as the per share merger consideration.  At or promptly following the effective time   of the merger, Microsoft will deposit sufficient funds to pay the aggregate   per share merger consideration with a designated paying agent.  Once a stockholder has provided the paying   agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or customary agents message   with respect to book-entry shares), letter of transmittal and the other items   specified by the paying agent, the paying agent will promptly pay the   stockholder the per share merger consideration.  For more information, see the section of   this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementExchange and Payment   Procedures.
 
After   the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share   merger consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder   (except that LinkedIn stockholders who properly and validly exercise and   perfect, and do not validly withdraw or subsequently lose, their appraisal   rights will have the right to receive a payment for the fair value of their   shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by   Delaware law, as described below under the section of this proxy statement   captioned The MergerAppraisal Rights).

and hold your shares of   common stock in street name through a bank, broker or other nominee, you   should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote   your shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your bank,   broker or other nominee.  Under   applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the   discretion to vote on routine matters.    The proposals to be considered at   the special meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and other   nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions.  Therefore, it is important that you cast   your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote   your shares.
 
If   you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your   proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by   (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior   to the special meeting; (2) submitting a new proxy electronically over   the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;   (3) delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate   Secretary; or (4) attending the special meeting and voting in person by   ballot.
 
If   you hold your shares of common stock in street name, you should contact your   bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your   vote.  You may also vote in person by   ballot at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank,   broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the   special meeting.
 
Recommendation   of the LinkedIn Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger
 
LinkedIns   Board of Directors, which we refer to as the LinkedIn Board, after   considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement   captioned The MergerRecommendation of the LinkedIn Board and Reasons for   the Merger, has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement,   the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement   are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of LinkedIn and its   stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the   merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The   LinkedIn Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) FOR the   adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the   special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to   solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the   merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the   proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or   may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection   with the merger.
 
Fairness   Opinion of Qatalyst Partners
 
In   connection with our consideration of strategic alternatives, we engaged   Qatalyst Partners LP, which we refer to as Qatalyst Partners, to provide   financial advice based on Qatalyst Partners qualifications, expertise,   reputation and knowledge of our business and the industry in which we   operate. At the meeting of the LinkedIn Board on June 11, 2016, Qatalyst   Partners rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that   as of June 11, 2016, and based upon and subject to the various   assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth in the   written opinion, the $196.00 per share merger consideration to be received by   the holders of our Class A common stock pursuant to the merger   agreement, other than Microsoft or any affiliates of Microsoft, in their   capacity as holders of our Class A common stock, which we refer to as   the Class A holders, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such   holders.
 
The full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners   to the LinkedIn Board, dated June 11, 2016, is attached to this proxy   statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by   reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,   procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of   the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You   should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners opinion   was provided to the LinkedIn Board and addressed only, as of the date of the   opinion, the fairness from a financial point of view of the $196.00 per share   merger consideration to be received by the holders of our Class A common   stock, other than Microsoft or any affiliates of Microsoft, pursuant to the   merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders. It does not   address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a   recommendation as to how any of our stockholders should vote with respect to   the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices   at which our Class A common stock will trade at any time.

Treatment of Equity Awards in the Merger
 
The   merger agreement provides that LinkedIns equity awards that are outstanding   immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be treated as   follows in the merger:
 
Company Options
 
Each   outstanding option to purchase shares of LinkedIn common stock granted   pursuant to any LinkedIn stock plan (including awards assumed in prior   transactions), which we refer to as company options, outstanding as of   immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is then   vested, or will vest as a result of the merger, which we refer to together as   surrendered company options, will, as of the effective time of the merger,   be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger   consideration of $196.00 for each share of LinkedIn common stock that would   have been issuable upon exercise of such surrendered company option prior to   the effective time of the merger less the applicable exercise price for each   such share of LinkedIn common stock under such surrendered company option and   less any applicable withholding taxes.    If the per share exercise price of any surrendered company option is   equal to or greater than $196.00, such surrendered company option will be   cancelled as of the effective time of the merger for no payment and will have   no further effect.
 
Each   company option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective   time of the merger, has an exercise price per share that is less than $196.00   and is not a surrendered company option,    which we refer to together as an assumed company option, will, as of   the effective time of the merger, be, as determined by Microsoft,   (1) assumed by Microsoft and converted into an option to acquire; or   (2) converted into an option granted pursuant to Microsofts 2001 Stock   Plan, as amended and restated, which we refer to as the Microsoft stock   plan, to acquire, in each case, on the same material terms and conditions as   were applicable to such assumed company option immediately prior to the   effective time of the merger, a number of shares of Microsoft common stock   equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of   (1) the number of shares of LinkedIn common stock subject to such   assumed company option as of immediately prior to the effective time of the   merger  multiplied by (2) the   stock award exchange ratio (as described in more detail under the section of   this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors   and Executive Officers in the Merger).    The per share exercise price for assumed company options will equal   the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing   (1) the per share exercise price for the LinkedIn common stock subject   to such assumed company option as of immediately prior to the effective time   of the merger by (2) the stock award exchange ratio.  Each company option that is outstanding as   of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, has an exercise   price per share that is equal to or greater than $196.00, and is not a   surrendered company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the   merger for no payment and will have no further effect.
 
Prior   to the closing date of the merger, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all   company options that would otherwise be assumed company options as vested   surrendered company options, which will become fully vested and then   cancelled and treated as a surrendered company option.
 
Company Stock-Based Awards
 
Each   right to receive or retain shares of LinkedIn common stock or receive a cash   payment equivalent granted pursuant to any LinkedIn stock plan (including   awards assumed in prior transactions), other than a company option, including   restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, which we refer to as   company stock-based awards, outstanding as of immediately prior to the   effective time of the merger that are vested as of immediately prior to the   effective time of the merger, or will vest as a result of the merger, which   we refer to as surrendered company stock-based awards, will, as of the   effective time of the merger, be cancelled and converted into the right to   receive the per share merger consideration of $196.00 with respect to each   share of LinkedIn common stock subject to the surrendered company-stock based   award, less any applicable withholding taxes.

Each   company stock-based award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the   effective time of the merger and is not a surrendered company stock-based   award,  which we refer to together as   an assumed company stock-based award, will, as of the effective time of the   merger, be, as determined by Microsoft, (1) assumed by Microsoft and   converted into a stock-based award; or (2) converted into a stock-based   award granted pursuant to the Microsoft stock plan, in each case, with the   same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such assumed company   stock-based award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, in   respect of a number of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to the product   (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (1) the number of shares of   LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company stock-based award as of   immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by   (2) the stock award exchange ratio.
 
Prior   to the closing date of the merger, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all   company stock-based awards that would otherwise be assumed company   stock-based awards as vested surrendered company stock-based awards, which   will become fully vested and then cancelled and treated as a surrendered   company stock-based award.
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
LinkedIns   executive officers will determine a date that is no later than one business   day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs as the   final exercise date for purposes of LinkedIns 2011 Employee Stock Purchase   Plan, which we refer to as the ESPP.    On such exercise date, LinkedIn will apply the funds credited as of   such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding   account to the purchase of whole shares of LinkedIn common stock in   accordance with the terms of the ESPP.    Subject to the consummation of the merger, the ESPP will terminate   immediately prior to and effective as of the effective time of the merger.
 
Pursuant   to the terms of the merger agreement, the LinkedIn Board has adopted   resolutions providing that each individual participating in the ESPP now will   not be permitted to increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to   the ESPP from the rate in effect when that offering period commenced, and   that each individual participating in the ESPP now or in any future offering   period will not be permitted to make separate non-payroll contributions to   the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement, except as may be   required by applicable law.  Prior to   the effective time of the merger, LinkedIn will take all actions that may be   necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause   any offering period that would otherwise be outstanding at the effective time   of the merger to be terminated no later than one business day prior to the   date on which the effective time of the merger occurs; (2) make any pro   rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering   period while treating the shortened offering period as a fully effective and   completed offering period for all purposes of the ESPP; (3) cause the   exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the   effective time of the merger occurs) of each outstanding purchase right   pursuant to the ESPP; and (4) provide that no further offering period or   purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the effective time   of the merger.
 
Employee Benefits
 
From   and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will   (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) honor all of   LinkedIns benefit plans and compensation and severance arrangements in   accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective   time of the merger. The surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause   the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries to) continue the   employment of all employees of LinkedIn and its subsidiaries as of the   effective time of the merger by taking such actions, if any, as are required   by applicable law. For a period of one year following the effective time of   the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and   Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to)   provide continuing employees with compensation, benefits, and severance   payments and benefits (other than equity-based compensation and individual   employment agreements, except as provided in the first sentence of this   paragraph) at levels that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the   aggregate than the compensation, benefits, and severance payments and   benefits (other than equity-based compensation and individual employment   agreements) provided to continuing employees immediately prior to the   effective time of the merger, either through (1) LinkedIns benefit   plans and arrangements in existence immediately prior to the effective time   of the merger, (2) comparable plans, or some combination of (1) and   (2).  In each case, base compensation   and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a   period of one year

following the effective   time of the merger for any continuing employee employed during that period   except in the ordinary course of business consistent with LinkedIns past   practice.  Additionally, for continuing   employees who terminate employment during the one year period following the   effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Microsoft   will cause the surviving corporation to) provide severance payments and   benefits to eligible employees in accordance with LinkedIns severance plans,   guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of the merger agreement.
 
To   the extent that a LinkedIn benefit plan or comparable plan is made available   to a continuing employee after the effective time of the merger (other than   with respect to certain exceptions), the surviving corporation and its   subsidiaries will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation or one   of its subsidiaries to) grant continuing employees credit for all service   with LinkedIn and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger   for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to   benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of   vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but excluding for purposes of   benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or post-employment   welfare plan), except that such service need not be credited to the extent   that it would result in duplication of benefits.  In addition, (1) each continuing   employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting   period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the surviving   corporation and its subsidiaries to the extent that coverage pursuant to any   such new benefit plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable LinkedIn   benefit plan or arrangement that the continuing employee participates in   immediately before the effective time of the merger; (2) for purposes of   each new benefit plan providing health and welfare benefits to a continuing   employee, the surviving corporation will cause all waiting periods,   pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and   actively-at-work or similar requirements of such new benefit plans to be   waived for such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, to the   extent waived under the corresponding LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement,   and the surviving corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by   such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion   of the plan year of the LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement ending on the   date that such continuing employees participation in the corresponding new   benefit plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such new benefit plan   for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum   out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or   her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had   been paid in accordance with such new benefit plan, to the extent credited   under the LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement; and (3) credit the   accounts of such continuing employees pursuant to any new benefit plan that   is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such   continuing employee.  Any vacation or   paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately   prior to the effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing   employee following the effective time of the merger in accordance with   LinkedIns vacation or paid time off policies in effect immediately prior to   the effective time of the merger.

Interests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive   Officers in the Merger
 
When considering the recommendation of the   LinkedIn Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger   agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may   have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your   interests as a stockholder. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger   agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending   that the merger agreement be adopted by LinkedIn stockholders, the LinkedIn   Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they   existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the   following:
 
·                  accelerated vesting, upon the effective   time of the merger, of the restricted stock units, which we refer to as RSUs, held by certain non-continuing   directors, pursuant to the LinkedIn 2011 Equity Incentive Plan and as   described in more detail below under the section of this proxy statement   captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIn Directors and Executive Officers   in the MergerTreatment of Equity-Based AwardsTreatment of Company   Stock-Based Awards; and
 
·                  the entitlement of each executive officer   to receive payments and benefits pursuant to arrangements entered into prior   to the commencement of discussions or negotiations regarding the merger,   including cash severance benefits and immediate vesting of 100% or 50%, as   applicable, of his or her outstanding company options or company stock-based   awards, under his or her existing offer letter or change of control agreement   if, within 12 months

following the merger, there is an involuntary termination of   employment without cause, or a constructive termination, as described in more   detail below under the section of this proxy statement captioned The   MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the   MergerPayments Upon Termination Following Change of  Control.
 
In addition, Mr. Weiner has entered into an   offer letter with Microsoft providing for his future employment following the   completion of the merger, as described in more detail below under the section   of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns   Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerEmployment Arrangements   Following the Merger.
 
If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is   approved, the common stock held by our directors and executive officers will   be treated in the same manner as the common stock held by all other   stockholders. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement   captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive   Officers in the Merger.
 
Appraisal Rights
 
If   the merger is consummated, LinkedIn stockholders who do not vote in favor of   the adoption of the merger agreement, who continuously hold such shares   through the effective time of the merger, and who properly perfect appraisal   of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the   merger under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of   Delaware, which we refer to as the DGCL.    This means that such stockholders are entitled to have their shares   appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of   the fair value of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements   of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,   together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value,   if any, as determined by the court.    Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish   to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal   counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
 
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware   that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to   Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the   value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger   agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
 
To   exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a   written demand for appraisal to LinkedIn before the vote is taken on the   proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or   otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; and   (3) continue to hold the subject shares of common stock of record   through the effective time of the merger. The failure to follow exactly the   procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal   rights.  The DGCL requirements for   exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy   statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is   attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.    If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or   other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult   with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate   procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your   bank, broker or other nominee.
 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of   the Merger
 
For   U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as   defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned The   MergerMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger) in   exchange for such U.S. Holders shares of common stock in the merger   generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount   measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S.   Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in   the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.
 
A   Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement   captioned The MergerMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the   Merger) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with   respect to

the exchange of common   stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain   connections to the United States.
 
For   more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned The   MergerMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.  Stockholders   should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax   consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular   circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal income tax laws   or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.
 
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
 
Under   the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until (1) the   applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements   Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act, has expired or   been terminated; and (2) the approval or clearance of the merger has   been granted by relevant antitrust authorities in the European Union and   Canada.
 
No Solicitation of Other Offers
 
Under   the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the   effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the merger   agreement), LinkedIn has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any   discussions or negotiations with and terminate any data room or other   diligence access of any person, its affiliates and its representatives (as   defined below) relating to an acquisition transaction  (as defined under the section of this proxy   statement captioned The Merger AgreementNo Solicitation of Other Offers)   and to request any person who executed a confidentiality agreement in   connection with its consideration of acquiring LinkedIn to promptly return or   destroy any non-public information furnished by or on behalf of LinkedIn   prior to the date of the merger agreement.
 
Under   the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the   effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the merger   agreement), LinkedIn has agreed not to, and to cause or direct, as the case   may be, its subsidiaries and its and their respective affiliates, directors,   officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors, whom   we collectively refer to as representatives, not to, among other things:   (1) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or   announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal   that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition   proposal (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned The   Merger AgreementNo Solicitation of Other Offers); (2) furnish or   otherwise provide access to any non-public information regarding, or to the   business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of, LinkedIn or its   subsidiaries to any person in connection with or with the intent to induce   the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate   or assist, an acquisition proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal   that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;   (3) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person   with respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to any inquiries from   third parties relating to making a potential acquisition proposal;   (4) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is   reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal; (5) enter into   any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,   acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an acquisition   transaction (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned   The Merger AgreementNo Solicitation of Other Offers); or   (6) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
 
Notwithstanding   these restrictions, under certain circumstances prior to the adoption of the   merger agreement by LinkedIn stockholders, LinkedIn may furnish information   to, and enter into negotiations or discussions with, a person regarding a   bona fide written acquisition proposal if the LinkedIn Board determines in   good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside   legal counsel that (1) such proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely   to lead to a superior proposal (as defined under the section of this proxy   statement captioned The Merger AgreementNo Solicitation of

Other Offers); and   (2) failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties   pursuant to applicable law.  For more   information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger   AgreementNo Solicitation of Other Offers.
 
LinkedIn   is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement   for a superior proposal unless it complies with certain procedures in the   merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with   Microsoft during a specified period.    If LinkedIn terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a   superior proposal, it must pay a $725 million termination fee to   Microsoft.  For more information, see   the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementThe   LinkedIn Boards Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change.
 
Change in the LinkedIn Boards Recommendation
 
The   LinkedIn Board may not withdraw its recommendation that LinkedIn stockholders   adopt the merger agreement or take certain similar actions other than, under   certain circumstances, if it determines in good faith, after consultation   with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would   be inconsistent with the LinkedIn Boards fiduciary duties pursuant to   applicable law and complies with the provisions of the merger agreement.
 
However,   the LinkedIn Board cannot withdraw its recommendation that LinkedIn   stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take certain similar actions   unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including   engaging in good faith negotiations with Microsoft during a specified   period.  If Microsoft terminates the   merger agreement because the LinkedIn Board withdraws its recommendation that   LinkedIn stockholders adopt the merger agreement or takes certain similar   actions, then LinkedIn must pay a $725 million termination fee to   Microsoft.  For more information, see   the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementThe   LinkedIn Boards Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change.
 
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger
 
The   obligations of LinkedIn, Microsoft and Merger Sub, as applicable, to   consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain   conditions, including (among other conditions), the following:
 
·                  the   adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of   LinkedIn stockholders;
 
·                  the   expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under, or   obtaining all requisite consents pursuant to, the HSR Act and the antitrust   laws of the European Union and Canada;
 
·                  the   consummation of the merger not being restrained, enjoined, rendered illegal   or otherwise prohibited by any law or order of any governmental authority;
 
·                  the   absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in   the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger   AgreementRepresentations and Warranties) or a material adverse effect with   respect to Microsoft and its subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the   merger agreement) having occurred after the date of merger agreement that is   continuing as of the effective time of the merger;
 
·                  the   accuracy of the representations and warranties of Microsoft and Merger Sub in   the merger agreement, subject to materiality qualifiers, as of the effective   time of the merger or the date in respect of which such representation or   warranty was specifically made;
 
·                  the   accuracy of the representations and warranties of LinkedIn in the merger   agreement, subject to materiality qualifiers, as of the effective time of the   merger or the date in respect of which such representation or warranty was   specifically made; and
         
10

·                  the   performance and compliance in all material respects by LinkedIn, Microsoft   and Merger Sub of and with their respective covenants and obligations   required to be performed and complied with by them under the merger agreement   at or prior to the effective time of the merger.
 
Termination of the Merger Agreement
 
The   merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of   the merger, whether before or after the adoption of the merger agreement by   LinkedIn stockholders, in the following ways:
 
·                  by   mutual written agreement of LinkedIn and Microsoft;
 
·                  by   either LinkedIn or Microsoft if:
 
·                  (1) a   permanent injunction or similar order issued by a court or other legal   restraint prohibiting consummation of the merger is in effect, or any action   taken by a governmental authority prohibiting the merger has become final and   non-appealable; or (2) any statute, regulation or order prohibiting the   merger has been enacted (except that a party may not terminate the merger   agreement pursuant to this provision if such party has failed to use its   reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent pursuant to,   resolve or lift, as applicable, such injunction, law or order);
 
·                  the merger has   not been consummated before January 11, 2017, which we refer to as the   termination date, except that if all conditions have been satisfied (other   than those conditions to be satisfied at the closing of the merger) or waived   (to the extent permitted by applicable law) by that date but on that date any   of the antitrust or competition-related conditions or the conditions related   to prohibitive laws or orders set forth in the merger agreement have not been   satisfied, then either LinkedIn or Microsoft may elect to extend the   termination date to June 11, 2017, but:
 
·                  a party may   not terminate the merger agreement if such partys action or failure to act   constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and is the primary cause of the   failure to consummate the merger by the termination date; and
 
·                  LinkedIn may   not terminate the merger agreement if it has not taken a stockholder vote on   the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting;
 
·                  the LinkedIn   stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting (except   that a party may not terminate the merger agreement if such partys action or   failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and is the   primary cause of the failure to obtain the approval of the LinkedIn   stockholders at the special meeting);
 
·                  by   LinkedIn if:
 
·                  after a cure   period, Microsoft or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform in any   material respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants   or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing   condition would not be satisfied;
 
·                  prior to the   adoption of the merger agreement by LinkedIn stockholders, (1) LinkedIn   has received a superior proposal; (2) the LinkedIn Board has authorized   LinkedIn to enter into an agreement to consummate the transaction   contemplated by such superior proposal, (3) LinkedIn pays Microsoft a   $725 million termination fee; and (4) LinkedIn has complied with its   non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement;
 
·                  by   Microsoft if:

·                  after a cure   period, LinkedIn has breached or failed to perform in any material respect   any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the   merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would not be   satisfied; or
 
·                  the LinkedIn   Board (1) withholds, withdraws, amends, qualifies or modifies, or   publicly proposes to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the   LinkedIn Boards recommendation in a manner adverse to Microsoft;   (2) adopts, approves, or recommends an acquisition proposal;   (3) fails to publicly reaffirm the LinkedIn Boards recommendation   within 10 business days of the occurrence of a material event or development   and after Microsoft so requests in writing (or if the special meeting is   scheduled to be held within 10 business days, then within one business day   after Microsoft so requests); (4) takes or fails to take any formal   action or makes or fails to make any recommendation in connection with a   tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a   stop, look and listen communication by the LinkedIn Board (or a committee   thereof) to LinkedIns stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated   under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); or   (5) fails to include the LinkedIn Boards recommendation in this proxy   statement.

LinkedIn will be required to pay to Microsoft a   termination fee of $725 million if the merger agreement is terminated in   specified circumstances.  For more   information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger   AgreementTermination Fee.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the special meeting.  These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you.  We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents we refer to in this proxy statement.  You may obtain the documents we file with the SEC without charge by following the instructions under the section of this proxy statement captioned Where You Can Find More Information.
 
Q:                                  Why am I receiving these materials?
 
A:                                   On June 11, 2016, LinkedIn entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into LinkedIn, pursuant to which LinkedIn will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference herein. In order to complete the merger, LinkedIn stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. The approval of this proposal by our stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementConditions to the Closing of the Merger.  The LinkedIn Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
 
A:                                   You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 
·                  to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into LinkedIn, and LinkedIn will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft;
 
·                  to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and
 
·                  to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Q:                                  When and where is the special meeting?
 
A:                                   The special meeting will take place on [·], 2016, at the Computer History Museum, 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View, CA 94043, at [·], Pacific time.
 
Q:                                  Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 
A:                                   LinkedIn stockholders as of the close of business on [·], 2016, which is the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of the special meeting and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were [·] shares of Class A common stock and [·] shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.  The Class A common stock and Class B common stock are voting as a single class on the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  May I attend the special meeting and vote in person?
 
A:                                   Yes.  Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all LinkedIn stockholders as of the record date may attend the special meeting and vote in person.  Seating will be limited.  Stockholders will need to present proof of

ownership of shares of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the special meeting.  No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the special meeting.
 
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.  If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
 
If you hold your shares in street name, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee.  Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, without your instructions.  If you hold your shares in street name, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on LinkedIn?
 
A:                                   The proposed merger is the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft.  If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by LinkedIn stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into LinkedIn, with LinkedIn continuing as the surviving corporation.  As a result of the merger, LinkedIn will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, and our Class A common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE.  In addition, our Class A common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
 
Q:                                  What will I receive if the merger is completed?
 
A:                                   Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $196.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost your appraisal rights under the DGCL.  For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $19,600.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
 
Q:                                  How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of the Class A common stock prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement?
 
A:                                   The per share merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 49.5% over the closing price of the Class A common stock on June 10, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement.
 
Q:                                  What do I need to do now?
 
A:                                   We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you.  Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting.  If you hold your shares in street name, please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.  Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Table of Contents
 
Q:                                  Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 
A:                                   No.  After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates or surrender your book-entry shares to the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common stock represented by your stock certificates.  You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates or book-entry shares for the cash payment to which you are entitled.  Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
 
Q:                                  What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting?
 
A:                                   The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be completed.  If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies LinkedIn in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger consideration, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.
 
Q:                                  How does the LinkedIn Board recommend that I vote?
 
A:                                   The LinkedIn Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) FOR the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Q:                                  Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 
A:                                   SEC rules require LinkedIn to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Q:                                  What is the compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
 
A:                                   The compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of LinkedIns named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in nature.  Compensation that will or may become payable by Microsoft to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not subject to this advisory vote.  For further detail, see the section of this proxy statement captioned Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.
 
Q:                                  What will happen if LinkedIn stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 
A:                                   Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger.  The vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on LinkedIn or Microsoft.  Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by LinkedIn stockholders
 
15





Table of Contents
 
and the merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger will or may be paid to LinkedIns named executive officers even if LinkedIn stockholders do not approve such compensation.
 
Q:                                  What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A:                                   If the merger agreement is not adopted by LinkedIn stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, LinkedIn stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock.  Instead, (1) LinkedIn will remain an independent public company; (2) our Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
 
Under specified circumstances, LinkedIn will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $725 million upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementTermination Fee.
 
Q:                                  What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?
 
A:                                   The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote on the proposal is required to adopt the merger agreement.
 
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.  If you hold your shares in street name, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.  Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
 
As a result of his ownership of approximately [·]% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date, Reid Hoffman, our co-founder and Chair of the LinkedIn Board, will have the power to approve the adoption of the proposals without the vote of any other stockholder.  Accordingly, if Mr. Hoffman votes his shares in favor of the proposals, the approval of the proposals is assured without the vote of any other stockholder.  Mr. Hoffman has informed us that he intends to vote all of his shares of common stock FOR each of the proposals.
 
Q:                                  What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 
A:                                   Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.  Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
 
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.  If you hold your shares in street name, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.  In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote

AGAINST the adjournment proposal and the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
As a result of his ownership of approximately [·]% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date, Reid Hoffman, our co-founder and Chair of the LinkedIn Board, will have the power to approve the adoption of the proposals without the vote of any other stockholder.  Accordingly, if Mr. Hoffman votes his shares in favor of the proposals, the approval of the proposals is assured without the vote of any other stockholder.  Mr. Hoffman has informed us that he intends to vote all of his shares of common stock FOR each of the proposals.
 
Q:                                  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 
A:                                   If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.  In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of LinkedIn.
 
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name.  In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.  As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting.  You are also invited to attend the special meeting.  However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  How may I vote?
 
A:                                   If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
 
·                  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 
·                  by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
 
·                  by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
 
·                  by attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.
 
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone.  Although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
 
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by proxy.  If you are a record holder or if you obtain a legal proxy to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock in person by ballot at the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy.  If you are present at the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
 
If your shares are held in street name through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone.  To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the
 
17





Table of Contents
 
instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.  However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  What is a proxy?
 
A:                                   A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a proxy, to vote your shares of common stock.  The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a proxy statement.  The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a proxy card.  Michael Callahan, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and Steven Sordello, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  If my broker holds my shares in street name, will my broker vote my shares for me?
 
A:                                   No.  Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote.  You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.  Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted AGAINST adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Q:                                  May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
 
A:                                   Yes.  If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
 
·                  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
 
·                  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 
·                  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
 
·                  attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.
 
If you hold your shares of common stock in street name, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.  You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
 
Q:                                  If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 
A:                                   Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares in the way that you direct.
 
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) FOR the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Q:                                  What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 
A:                                   Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive.
 
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards.  For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares.  If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.  Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
 
Q:                                  Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 
A:                                   If available, LinkedIn may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting.  LinkedIn intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting.  All reports that LinkedIn files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.  See the section of this proxy statement captioned Where You Can Find More Information.
 
Q:                                  Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?
 
A:                                   If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.
 
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.
 
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.  A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.
 
Q:                                  What will the holders of company options and company stock-based awards receive in the merger?
 
A:                                   Generally, at the effective time of the merger, each company option and company stock-based award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger that is unvested will be assumed or substituted for by Microsoft and automatically converted into a corresponding equity award representing the right to acquire, on the same material terms and conditions, an adjusted number of shares of Microsoft common stock, subject to certain exceptions.  The number of shares of Microsoft common stock subject to the new equity awards will be determined by a stock award exchange ratio based on the relative value of the per share merger consideration ($196.00) and the volume weighted average price per share of Microsoft common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending with the complete trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date of the merger, with a corresponding adjustment to be made to the exercise prices of company options.  Any outstanding company options or company stock-based awards that are vested, will become vested in connection with the merger, or that are designated by Microsoft as cancelled awards instead will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less any amounts required to be deducted or withheld by law) determined by multiplying $196.00 by the number of outstanding shares of LinkedIn common stock subject to the award (and in the case of company options, less applicable exercise prices).
 
19






Table of Contents
 
Also, each executive officer is eligible to receive immediate vesting of 100% or 50%, as applicable, of his or her outstanding company options or company stock-based awards under his or her offer letter or change of control agreement if, within 12 months following the merger, there is an involuntary termination of employment without cause, or a constructive termination as defined in the applicable offer letter or change of control agreement and as described more fully below.
 
Q:                                  What will happen to the ESPP?
 
A:                                   LinkedIns executive officers will determine the final exercise date for purposes of the ESPP.  On such exercise date, LinkedIn will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of LinkedIn common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.  Subject to the consummation of the merger, the ESPP will terminate immediately prior to and effective as of the effective time of the merger.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the LinkedIn Board has adopted resolutions providing that each individual participating in the ESPP now will not be permitted to increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when that offering period commenced and that each individual participating in the ESPP now or in any future offering period will not be permitted to make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement, except as may be required by applicable law.  Prior to the effective time of the merger, LinkedIn will take all actions that may be necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause any offering period that would otherwise be outstanding at the effective time of the merger to be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs; (2) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period while treating the shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes of the ESPP; (3) cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (4) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the effective time of the merger.
 
Q:                                  When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 
A:                                   We currently expect to complete the merger this calendar year.  However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
 
Q:                                  Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 
A:                                   If the merger is consummated, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly perfect appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.  This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court.  Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.  The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
 
Q:                                  Do any of LinkedIns directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of LinkedIn stockholders generally?
 
A:                                   Yes.  In considering the recommendation of the LinkedIn Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of LinkedIn stockholders generally.  In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by LinkedIn stockholders, the LinkedIn Board was aware of and considered these interests to the

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain forward-looking statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts.  You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as may, should, could, project, believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, continue, potential, plan, forecast and other words of similar import.  Stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:
 
·                  the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of LinkedIn stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;
 
·                  the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $725 million;
 
·                  the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement;
 
·                  risks that the merger affects our ability to retain or recruit employees;
 
·                  the fact that receipt of the all-cash merger consideration would be taxable to LinkedIn stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 
·                  the fact that, if the merger is completed, LinkedIn stockholders will forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of LinkedIns current strategy as an independent company;
 
·                  the possibility that Microsoft could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special dividends or the sale of some or all of LinkedIns assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than that available to LinkedIn stockholders in the merger;
 
·                  the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, LinkedIn is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger;
 
·                  the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, operating results and business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of LinkedIn management or employees during the pendency of the merger;
 
·                  the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;
 
·                  the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the merger is not completed; and
 
·                  risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the merger, including the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals from various domestic and foreign governmental bodies (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals) and the risk that one or more governmental bodies may deny approval.

THE SPECIAL MEETING
 
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the LinkedIn Board for use at the special meeting.
 
Date, Time and Place
 
We will hold the special meeting on [·], 2016, at the Computer History Museum, 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View, CA 94043, at [·], Pacific time.
 
Purpose of the Special Meeting
 
At the special meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
 
Only LinkedIn stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting.  A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at our principal executive offices located at 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the special meeting and at the place of the special meeting during the meeting.
 
As of the record date, there were [·] shares of Class A common stock and [·] shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.  Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.  The Class A common stock and Class B common stock are voting as a single class on the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.
 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of common stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum at the special meeting.  In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
 
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
 
Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.  Adoption of the merger agreement by LinkedIns stockholders is a condition to the closing of the merger.
 
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.  Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
 
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted AGAINST the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.  For stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and vote to abstain, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted AGAINST any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger

agreement at the time of the special meeting and AGAINST the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
A broker non-vote generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.  We do not expect any broker non-votes, at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.  If there are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote AGAINST the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on (1) any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; or (2) the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
As a result of his ownership of approximately [·]% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date, Reid Hoffman, our co-founder and Chair of the LinkedIn Board, will have the power to approve the adoption of the proposals without the vote of any other stockholder.  Accordingly, if Mr. Hoffman votes his shares in favor of the proposals, the approval of the proposals is assured without the vote of any other stockholder.  Mr. Hoffman has informed us that he intends to vote all of his shares of common stock FOR each of the proposals.
 
Shares Held by LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers
 
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, [·] shares of common stock, representing approximately [·]% of the shares of common stock, and approximately [·]% of the total voting power of the shares of common stock, outstanding on the record date.  Our co-founder and Chair of the Board of Directors, Reid Hoffman, beneficially owned and was entitled to vote, in the aggregate, [·] shares of common stock, representing approximately [·]% of the shares of common stock, and approximately [·]% of the total voting power of the shares of common stock, outstanding on the record date.  Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote all of their shares of common stock (1) FOR the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Voting of Proxies
 
If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you may cause your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or you may vote in person by ballot at the special meeting.  Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone by following the instructions on your proxy card.  You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.  Based on your proxy cards or internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.
 
If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting.  Stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of shares of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the special meeting.  If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.  If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
 
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder.  Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (1) FOR adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient

votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
If your shares are held in street name through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the special meeting and voting in person with a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.  If available, you may vote over the internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.  If you do not return your banks, brokers or other nominees voting instruction form, do not vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the special meeting and vote in person with a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted AGAINST the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will not have any effect on the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Revocability of Proxies
 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
 
·                  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
 
·                  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 
·                  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
 
·                  attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.
 
If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the special meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.
 
If you hold your shares of common stock in street name, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.  You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
 
Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the special meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, will allow LinkedIn stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.
 
The LinkedIn Boards Recommendation
 
The LinkedIn Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerRecommendation of the LinkedIn Board and Reasons for the Merger, has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on and subject to the conditions set forth therein, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of LinkedIn and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in all respects. The LinkedIn Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) FOR the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the proposal to approve, by non-binding,

advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Adjournment
 
In addition to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, LinkedIn stockholders are also being asked to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. This will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional votes in favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal. If a quorum is not present, the chair of the special meeting may adjourn the special meeting. In addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals.
 
Solicitation of Proxies
 
The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by LinkedIn.  We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a professional proxy solicitation firm, to solicit proxies in connection with the special meeting at a cost of approximately $20,000 plus expenses.  We will also indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf.  In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners.  Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax or over the internet.  No additional compensation will be paid for such services.
 
Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger
 
We currently expect to complete the merger this calendar year.  However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
 
Appraisal Rights
 
If the merger is consummated, LinkedIn stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly perfect appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.  This means that such holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, LinkedIn stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
 
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
 
To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to LinkedIn before the vote is taken on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; and (3) continue to hold the subject shares of record through the effective time of the merger.  The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights.  The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.  If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee.
 
Other Matters
 
At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the special meeting.  If any other matters properly come before the special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxy holders.

Liberty Merger Sub Inc.
c/o Microsoft Corporation
One Microsoft Way
Redmond, WA 95054
(425) 882-8080
 
Merger Sub is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Microsoft and was formed on June 10, 2016, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
 
Effect of the Merger
 
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into LinkedIn, with LinkedIn continuing as the surviving corporation.  As a result of the merger, LinkedIn will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, and our Class A common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE.  In addition, our Class A common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.  If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with and acceptance of such certificate by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as we, Microsoft and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).
 
Effect on LinkedIn if the Merger is Not Completed
 
If the merger agreement is not adopted by LinkedIn stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, LinkedIn stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock.  Instead, LinkedIn will remain an independent public company, our Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.  In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that our management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that LinkedIn stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which LinkedIn operates and adverse economic conditions.
 
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, the price of our Class A common stock may decline significantly.  If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our Class A common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
 
Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of common stock.  If the merger is not completed, the LinkedIn Board will continue to evaluate and review, among other things, LinkedIns business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate.  If the merger agreement is not adopted by LinkedIn stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, LinkedIns business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.
 
Under specified circumstances, LinkedIn will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $725 million upon the termination of the merger agreement.  For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementTermination Fee.
 
Merger Consideration
 
In the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares held by (1) LinkedIn as treasury stock; (2) Microsoft, Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries; and (3) LinkedIn stockholders who have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration.
 
After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementConversion of Shares, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that LinkedIn stockholders who properly exercise and do not validly withdraw or subsequently lose their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned Appraisal Rights).

Background of the Merger
 
LinkedIn is the worlds largest professional network on the internet and its members use LinkedIns platform to stay connected and informed, advance their career and work smarter. Reid Hoffman, the Chair of the LinkedIn Board and a co-founder of LinkedIn, has had a long-term vision for LinkedIn  to create economic opportunity for every professional in the world  since its founding in 2002.  In connection with its initial public offering in 2011, LinkedIn created a dual class common stock structure, which provided LinkedIns founders, pre-initial public offering investors, executives and employees with influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.
 
The LinkedIn Board regularly evaluates LinkedIns strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward executing on LinkedIns vision and mission, strengthening its core businesses and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the LinkedIn Board has from time to time considered a variety of strategic alternatives, including (1) the continuation of LinkedIns current business plan as a standalone entity; (2) modifications to LinkedIns business plan and strategy; and (3) potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through acquisitions and combinations of LinkedIn with other businesses.
 
On February 16, 2016, Jeff Weiner, LinkedIns chief executive officer, met with Satya Nadella, Microsofts chief executive officer, to discuss the ongoing commercial relationship between the companies and ways to enhance it. At this meeting, Messrs. Weiner and Nadella discussed ways in which the two companies could work together more closely and, in the context of that discussion, among other things, the concept of a business combination was raised.
 
On March 10, 2016, Mr. Weiner met with an executive of a company, which we refer to as Party A, at the executives request. During the meeting, the executive of Party A stated to Mr. Weiner that he and the chief executive officer of Party A had previously discussed ways in which Party A could enhance its business relationship with LinkedIn, as well as a potential acquisition of LinkedIn by Party A.
 
On March 14, 2016, at a function attended by both Mr. Weiner and the chief executive officer of Party A, Mr. Weiner spoke with the chief executive officer of Party A, who requested that the two speak further about potential strategic opportunities for LinkedIn and Party A.
 
Also on March 14, 2016, Mr. Hoffman held a previously scheduled meeting with a senior executive of a company, which we refer to as Party B.  Later on March 14, 2016, the senior executive of Party B contacted each of Messrs. Hoffman and Weiner separately to set up an additional meeting in the near future to explore a potential business combination transaction.
 
On March 15, 2016, Mr. Weiner called Mr. Nadella to inquire as to whether Microsoft was interested in discussing further a potential acquisition of LinkedIn, and explained that, although
 
31





Table of Contents
 
LinkedIn was not for sale, others had expressed interest in an acquisition. Mr. Nadella responded that he would discuss the matter further with Microsofts board of directors.
 
On March 16, 2016, at the request of the chief executive officer of Party A, Mr. Weiner met with the chief executive officer of Party A, who informed Mr. Weiner that Party A had engaged a financial advisor for purposes of analyzing a potential acquisition of LinkedIn by Party A and that Party A was interested in pursuing an acquisition. The chief executive officer of Party A also discussed with Mr. Weiner the current business of Party A and the potential benefits of a combination of Party A and LinkedIn.
 
Also on March 16, 2016, Mr. Nadella spoke with Mr. Weiner, at which time Mr. Nadella confirmed that Microsoft was interested in pursuing an acquisition of LinkedIn and that Microsoft had begun work on the project.
 
On March 18, 2016, the LinkedIn Board met, with representatives of LinkedIn management and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, outside legal counsel to LinkedIn, which we refer to as Wilson Sonsini, in attendance. The members of the LinkedIn Board discussed the recent indications of interest with respect to a potential acquisition of LinkedIn from Party A, Party B and Microsoft. The members of the LinkedIn Board also discussed contacting other companies that may have an interest in acquiring LinkedIn. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the LinkedIn Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a potential sale of LinkedIn. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini also discussed with the members of the LinkedIn Board the fiduciary and other considerations related to the fact that Mr. Hoffman, through his ownership of Class B common stock, controlled more than a majority of the outstanding voting power of LinkedIn and therefore would be able to approve or prevent any potential transaction. Mr. Hoffman informed the other members of the LinkedIn Board that, should such a transaction proceed, he expected to be treated the same as the other stockholders of LinkedIn and would not expect to receive, or seek to receive, any special or different consideration. In light of the potentially significant workload involved in exploring strategic alternatives and the possibility that in connection with such exploration LinkedIn management might need feedback and direction on relatively short notice, the LinkedIn Board created a transactions committee, which we refer to as the Transactions Committee. The Transactions Committee was authorized to advise and direct LinkedIn management with respect to the exploration, consideration and negotiation of strategic alternative transactions, to facilitate negotiation, and to report to the LinkedIn Board on a regular basis. The LinkedIn Board retained authority to approve any transaction. The LinkedIn Board appointed A. George Skip Battle, Michael Moritz and Stanley Meresman to the Transactions Committee. The LinkedIn Board also authorized the Company to engage Qatalyst Partners, on terms acceptable to the Transactions Committee, to assist LinkedIn with respect to its exploration of strategic alternative transactions.
 
Later on March 18, 2016, Mr. Weiner attended a meeting previously scheduled by Qatalyst Partners. During the meeting, Mr. Weiner spoke with a representative of Qatalyst Partners about potentially engaging Qatalyst Partners to act as LinkedIns financial advisor for purposes of assisting with the exploration of strategic alternative transactions.
 
On March 21, 2016, the chief executive officer of Party A emailed Mr. Weiner to inquire about meeting to further discuss a potential acquisition.

On May 6, 2016, the LinkedIn Board met, with representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance.

The Transactions Committee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini the revised proposals that had been submitted by Microsoft and Party A and the next steps with regard to further discussions with each. The Transactions Committee and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Allen also noted that, based on prior conversations with Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Hoffmans preference would likely be for consideration that consisted of a mix of cash and stock in a transaction intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, in light of the value of the deferral of taxes on the stock portion of the consideration. The Transactions Committee authorized representatives of Qatalyst Partners to respond to Party A and Microsoft with requests for increased offers.
 
The representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted each of Party A and Microsoft, consistent with the Transactions Committees instructions.
 
On May 12, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with Mr. Hoffman and representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance. The Transactions Committee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Allen the process to date with respect to discussions with Microsoft and Party A. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that Party A had indicated that although Party A preferred a negotiation to an auction, if there were to be an auction, Party A expected that all parties bids would be considered at once.  With respect to Microsoft, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that Microsoft expressed a similar concern relating to continued incremental bidding and was seeking guidance with respect to an acceptable price. The members of the Transactions Committee then discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and instructed the representatives of Qatalyst Partners to request best and final bids from each of Party A and Microsoft, and indicate to each of the bidders that following receipt and consideration of the bids, in the event LinkedIn chose to move forward, LinkedIn intended to choose only one party with whom to pursue exclusive negotiations. The Transactions Committee concluded that this would alleviate concerns regarding the potential for a bid to be shopped and make a more aggressive offer more

likely. The Transactions Committee also considered the length of the process to date and the depth of interactions with each of the parties as well as the fact that prolonged continuation of the process would likely be an increasing distraction for management of the Company and have potential for leaks in the media that could be damaging to the Companys business. In light of these considerations, the Transactions Committee instructed the representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform both Microsoft and Party A that they were to submit best and final offers to acquire LinkedIn prior to the LinkedIn Board meeting scheduled for the afternoon of May 13, 2016.  Mr. Hoffman informed the Transactions Committee that he wished to call Mr. Nadella and indicate that he would personally support a transaction with Microsoft at $185 per share or greater if the LinkedIn Board chose Microsoft as the winning bidder after the receipt of best and final offers.
 
Later on May 12, 2016, and on May 13, 2016, Mr. Hoffman conveyed to Mr. Nadella the message he discussed with the Transactions Committee. Also on May 12, 2016, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with (1) representatives of Party A and their financial advisor and (2) representatives of Microsoft and Morgan Stanley and conveyed to the respective parties the messages instructed by the Transactions Committee.
 
On May 13, 2016, Microsoft submitted a revised proposal in response to the request for best and final offers for an acquisition of LinkedIn at a price of $182 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock, with the flexibility to include Microsoft common stock as part of the mix of consideration if requested by LinkedIn.  Later that afternoon, Party A submitted a revised proposal in response to the request for best and final offers for an acquisition of LinkedIn for $182 per share of LinkedIn common stock, consisting of $85 in cash and the remainder in Party A common stock.  Both proposals requested that LinkedIn negotiate on an exclusive basis.
 
Later on May 13, 2016, the LinkedIn Board met, with representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance. The members of the LinkedIn Board reviewed and discussed the process to date, and the terms of the proposals submitted by Microsoft and Party A in response to the request for best and final offers. The members of the LinkedIn Board and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Allen discussed various considerations raised by the two proposals, including, among other things, (1) the value certainty of the respective proposals; (2) the historical volatility of the stock price of each of Microsoft and Party A; (3) the execution risks of the respective proposals; (4) certainty of closing, including the need for the approval of Party As stockholders; and (5) the relative financing needs of each of Microsoft and Party A. The LinkedIn Board considered, in light of LinkedIns request for best and final offers and messaging regarding the process previously delivered to each bidder, the potential effects of calling one or both parties to seek an increased proposal and the risk to the process of potentially alienating one or both parties by doing so.  The representatives of Wilson Sonsini then reviewed with the members of the LinkedIn Board their fiduciary obligations.  The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the LinkedIn Board that a definitive agreement for a transaction would be expected to permit LinkedIn to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals and accept a superior proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee.  The LinkedIn Board discussed the two proposals and unanimously concluded to proceed with exclusivity with Microsoft. The LinkedIn Board discussed negotiating with Microsoft to explore structuring the transaction to include Microsoft stock, and have the stock component of the merger consideration be tax-deferred to stockholders, something for

which Mr. Hoffman expressed his preference. In this regard, the LinkedIn Board also discussed proposing a mechanism whereby Microsoft would provide some level of price certainty for shares issued in the transaction. The LinkedIn Board authorized LinkedIn to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Microsoft.
 
Immediately following the meeting of the LinkedIn Board on May 13, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with Mr. Hoffman and representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance.

Later, on May 13, 2016, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, on behalf of LinkedIn, informed Party A that LinkedIn was proceeding to enter into an exclusivity agreement with another party.
 
On May 14, 2016, LinkedIn signed an exclusivity agreement with Microsoft that expired on June 12, 2016.  The exclusivity agreement, among other things, prohibited LinkedIn from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals or engaging in negotiations with other parties regarding an alternative acquisition.
 
Beginning May 14, 2016, and continuing until the signing of the merger agreement, Microsoft continued its due diligence review of LinkedIn through in person meetings, telephone calls and access to an electronic data room made available by LinkedIn. Beginning at the same time and ending June 6, 2016, the parties engaged in discussions regarding the terms of a collar in order to introduce a degree of price certainty for the stock component of the consideration being discussed.
 
On May 16, 2016, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, provided Simpson Thacher with a draft of the merger agreement, which, among other things, (1) provided LinkedIn with the right to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal; and (2) proposed consideration that consisted of a mix of cash and stock in a transaction intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.
 
On May 20, 2016, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, provided Wilson Sonsini with a revised draft of the merger agreement. Among other things, the revised draft of the merger agreement: (1) provided for a support agreement to be entered into by Mr. Hoffman, a draft of which was also provided by Simpson Thacher; (2) reserved for future comments on the form of merger consideration and antitrust matters; (3) indicated that LinkedIns proposal that it have the right to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal was subject to additional discussions between the parties; and (4) included revisions to the circumstances in which a termination fee would be payable by LinkedIn.
 
Later on May 20, 2016, LinkedIn received a revised proposal from Party A for an acquisition of LinkedIn for $85 in cash and a fixed number of shares of Party A common stock which, based on the closing price of Party As common stock on May 19, 2016, represented a proposal with a notional value at that time of approximately $188 per share of LinkedIn common stock.
 
On May 21, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with Mr. Hoffman and representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance. The

members of the Transactions Committee discussed with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, next steps with respect to the receipt of the revised proposal from Party A in light of the terms of the exclusivity agreement with Microsoft and the confidentiality agreement with Party A. The Transactions Committee noted that the revised proposal was in fact quite similar economically to the implied value of the proposal sent by Party A on May 13, 2016, at the time it was sent, insofar as the implied floating stock exchange ratio of the May 13, 2016 proposal, using Party As trading price on May 13, 2016, was the same as the fixed stock exchange ratio in the revised proposal of May 20, 2016; the increase in the notional value of Party As proposal was attributable to the increase in Party As trading price between May 13, 2016, and May 20, 2016. The Transactions Committee also discussed factors that could be affecting Party As trading price. The Transactions Committee then discussed the appropriate manner in which to address the revised Party A proposal in light of the LinkedIn Boards fiduciary and contractual obligations. The Transactions Committee concluded it could not respond to Party A in light of LinkedIns exclusivity agreement with Microsoft.  The Transactions Committee further concluded that LinkedIn would continue negotiations with Microsoft and evaluate the situation further closer to the expiration of the exclusivity period with Microsoft, and after Microsofts due diligence was substantially completed. In this regard, those present discussed the need to preserve flexibility in the negotiations with Microsoft in the event that Party A remained interested in acquiring LinkedIn closer to the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 
On May 25, 2016, the chief executive officer of Party A emailed Messrs. Hoffman and Weiner to indicate that Party As stock performance since Party As revised proposal was sent on May 20, 2016, had increased the notional value of its revised proposal.
 
Later on May 25, 2016, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, provided Simpson Thacher with a revised draft of the merger agreement. Among other things, the revised draft of the merger agreement: (1) noted that the support agreement proposed to be entered into by Mr. Hoffman was under review by Mr. Hoffman; (2) indicated that the form of merger consideration and antitrust matters remained under review by the parties; (3) provided for LinkedIns right to terminate the agreement in the event of a superior proposal; and (4) indicated that the amount of a termination fee that would be payable by LinkedIn remained under review by the parties.
 
On May 26, 2016, the LinkedIn Board met, with representatives of LinkedIn management and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The LinkedIn Board discussed the current state of due diligence and negotiations with Microsoft and again reviewed the LinkedIn long-term management plan.
 
On June 1, 2016, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, provided Wilson Sonsini with a revised draft of the merger agreement. The revised draft of the merger agreement provided, among other things, (1) for limitations with respect to Microsofts obligations in connection with antitrust matters; and (2) a termination fee of 3.85% of the fully diluted equity value of LinkedIn, which would represent approximately $1 billion, that would be payable in certain circumstances by LinkedIn.
 
Later on June 1, 2016, Mr. Hoffman informed the Company that he would not be prepared to enter into the support agreement with Microsoft in light of the potential risk that doing so could,

under LinkedIns certificate of incorporation, potentially result in the automatic conversion of his Class B common stock to Class A common stock.
 
On June 3, 2016, representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Weil Gotshal & Manges, counsel to Mr. Hoffman, Simpson Thacher and Richards, Layton & Finger, Delaware counsel to Microsoft, held a conference call to discuss the support agreement and issues relating to the automatic conversion feature in LinkedIns certificate of incorporation.  Following this call, representatives of Simpson Thacher indicated to Wilson Sonsini that if Microsoft would not receive a support agreement from Mr. Hoffman, it would seek additional provisions in the merger agreement to address the additional conditionality that it would introduce to the deal.
 
On June 4, 2016, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, provided Simpson Thacher with a revised draft of the merger agreement and a draft of the disclosure letter to the merger agreement. Among other things, the revised draft of the merger agreement:(1) provided that Mr. Hoffman would not enter into a support agreement; (2) included additional covenants with respect to Microsofts obligations in connection with antitrust matters; and (3) provided for a termination fee of 1.75% of the fully diluted equity value of LinkedIn, which would represent approximately $450 million, that would be payable in certain circumstances by LinkedIn.
 
On June 5, 2016, LinkedIn received a further revised proposal from Party A for an acquisition of LinkedIn at a price per share of LinkedIn common stock of $85 in cash and a fixed number of shares of Party A common stock, which fixed number of Party A shares was increased from Party As May 20, 2016 proposal. Based on the closing price of Party As common stock on June 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to receipt of the proposal, this proposal represented a notional value of approximately $200 per share of LinkedIn common stock at that time.
 
Also on June 5, 2016, Mr. Nadella and Mr. Weiner spoke and discussed operating principles and a governance framework for the LinkedIn business following the acquisition.
 
On June 6, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with Mr. Hoffman and representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance. The respective representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Transactions Committee the process with respect to the receipt of the revised proposal from Party A in light of the terms of the exclusivity agreement with Microsoft and the confidentiality agreement with Party A. The Transactions Committee noted that the material difference in the revised proposal relative to the revised proposal from Party A of May 20, 2016, was that the fixed stock exchange ratio had been increased. The Transactions Committee then discussed the appropriate manner in which to address the further revised proposal in light of the LinkedIn Boards fiduciary and contractual obligations. The Transactions Committee determined, in light of the prohibition in LinkedIns exclusivity agreement with Microsoft on discussions with other parties, not to respond to Party A and to continue negotiations with Microsoft and to indicate to Microsoft that Microsofts current proposal of $182 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock was no longer supportable and encourage Microsoft to offer $200 per share. Mr. Weiner informed the members of the Transactions Committee that he had spoken to Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Hoffman was now also supportive of the consideration in an acquisition of LinkedIn being entirely in the form of cash, in addition to remaining comfortable with a cash and stock transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with the Transactions Committee that an acquisition entirely for cash would be more attractive to Microsoft.

Also on June 6, 2016, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to representatives of Morgan Stanley and, in the context of the expected timing of entry into a merger agreement prior to the expiration of exclusivity, conveyed that Microsofts proposal of $182 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock was no longer supportable, Microsoft should consider an offer of $200 per share and Mr. Hoffman was now supportive of the consideration being entirely in the form of cash as part of an increase to Microsofts offer.
 
On June 7, 2016, and June 8, 2016, during conversations concerning the status of the transaction, Messrs. Hoffman and Weiner separately communicated to Mr. Nadella that a transaction at $182 per share of LinkedIn common stock was no longer supportable and encouraged Mr. Nadella to offer $200 per share. In the course of these conversations, Mr. Hoffman indicated that he was willing to consider an all-cash transaction with Microsoft as part of an increase in Microsofts offer. Mr. Nadella also indicated to Mr. Weiner that a discussion of cost synergies in the transaction would be necessary in connection with any potential price increase from Microsoft.  Also on June 8, 2016, Brad Smith, Microsofts president and chief legal officer, separately spoke with Mr. Battle and met with Mr. Callahan and conveyed to each that any potential increase in Microsofts offer would necessitate a discussion of cost synergies.
 
On June 9, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance. Representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners and Allen discussed with the members of the Transactions Committee the strategy for obtaining a higher offer from Microsoft in light of the two revised proposals from Party A. Mr. Weiner noted that Mr. Nadella had informed him that Microsoft would need to identify cost synergies in connection with any increase in its offer. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the members of the Transactions Committee the key differences between the latest revised proposal from Party A and the current proposal from Microsoft. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Transactions Committee their fiduciary duties in light of the Microsoft proposal and the receipt of the revised proposal from Party A.
 
Also on June 9, 2016, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, provided Wilson Sonsini with a revised draft of the disclosure letter to the merger agreement.
 
Later on June 9, 2016, Mr. Nadella met with Mr. Weiner to discuss integration planning and potential cost synergies arising from the combination and the status of the transaction generally. At that meeting, Mr. Weiner reiterated that $182 was no longer supportable.
 
On June 10, 2016, Mr. Sordello sent Amy Hood, Microsofts chief financial officer, an analysis of potential cost synergies arising from the combination. Later that day, Mr. Sordello and Ms. Hood discussed various potential cost synergies arising from the combination. Later that day, Microsoft delivered a revised proposal to LinkedIn that provided for an acquisition of LinkedIn for $190 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock.  Messrs. Nadella and Smith also called Messrs. Weiner and Callahan, respectively, to convey the proposal verbally.

Also on June 10, 2016, Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, provided Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, with a revised draft of the merger agreement. Among other things, the revised draft of the merger agreement: (1) provided for Messrs. Hoffman and Weiner to each enter into a support agreement whereby each would, among other things, agree not to enter into any voting agreement with a third party; (2) indicated that the form of merger consideration would be all cash; (3) included changes to covenants with respect to Microsofts obligations in connection with antitrust matters; and (4) provided for a termination fee of 3.75% of the fully diluted equity value of LinkedIn, which would represent approximately $1 billion, that would be payable in certain circumstances by LinkedIn.
 
Later on June 10, 2016, representatives of Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, negotiated the merger agreement with representatives of Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft.  As a part of this conversation, it was conveyed that Messrs. Hoffman and Weiner would not enter into any type of support agreement with Microsoft. In addition, there remained open issues regarding antitrust matters, the amount of the termination fee and the circumstances under which it would be payable.
 
Later on June 10, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini, respectively, in attendance. Mr. Weiner updated the members of the Transactions Committee on his conversation the prior evening with Mr. Nadella. The members of the Transactions Committee discussed the revised offer for $190 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock that had been delivered earlier that day. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the status of the negotiation of the merger agreement, noting that, in addition to price, the antitrust provisions, the amount of the termination fee payable and the circumstances under which it would be payable were the other remaining material points to negotiate. The Transactions Committee then authorized Mr. Weiner to continue discussions with Mr. Nadella for the purpose of (1) emphasizing that Microsoft needed to offer the highest price possible; (2) emphasizing the risks inherent to Microsoft in allowing the exclusivity period to lapse without entering into a merger agreement; and (3) conveying that there was some support for a transaction with Microsoft at $196 per share in cash (but that any transaction would require full board approval).
 
Later on June 10, 2016, Mr. Weiner spoke with Mr. Nadella  and relayed the discussion items authorized by the Transactions Committee.
 
Early in the morning of June 11, 2016, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, provided Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, with a revised draft of the merger agreement and a revised draft of the disclosure letter to the merger agreement. The revised draft of the merger agreement provided, among other things, (1) there would not be any support agreement; (2) additional covenants with respect to Microsofts obligations in connection with antitrust matters; and (3) a termination fee of $700 million, that would be payable in certain circumstances by LinkedIn, with a reduced termination fee payable in the event of a termination of the merger agreement due to a failure to obtain LinkedIn stockholder approval.
 
Also in the morning of June 11, 2016, Mr. Nadella informed Mr. Weiner that Microsofts board of directors had approved a revised proposal for an acquisition of LinkedIn at a price of $196 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock and that Microsoft wanted to finalize and execute the

merger agreement later that day. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft sent Mr. Weiner a revised proposal for an acquisition of LinkedIn for $196 in cash per share of LinkedIn common stock.
 
Later in the morning of June 11, 2016, Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LinkedIn, and Simpson Thacher, on behalf of Microsoft, negotiated the final versions of the merger agreement and the disclosure letter to the merger agreement. As part of these negotiations, the parties agreed on the scope of antitrust provisions and agreed on a termination fee of $725 million.  Simpson Thacher stated that Microsoft required as a condition to proceeding with a transaction that the full termination fee be payable in the event of a termination of the merger agreement due to a failure to obtain LinkedIn stockholder approval.
 
In the afternoon of June 11, 2016, the LinkedIn Board met, with the respective representatives of LinkedIn management, Qatalyst Partners, Allen, Wilson Sonsini and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, outside antitrust counsel to LinkedIn, which we refer to as Gibson Dunn, in attendance. During the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Allen and Wilson Sonsini reviewed the terms of the merger agreement and Microsofts proposal for an acquisition of LinkedIn at $196 per share in cash as well as the terms of the most recent proposal from Party A. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the LinkedIn Board their fiduciary duties, including the relevant judicial standards of review and the process associated with a decision by the LinkedIn Board to engage in the proposed transaction. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the process to date, including the proposals that had been made by Microsoft and Party A both prior to entering into exclusivity with Microsoft, and thereafter. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini also reported on negotiations with Microsoft with respect to the terms of the merger agreement. A representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed with the members of the LinkedIn Board antitrust matters applicable to the merger agreement. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the members of the LinkedIn Board Qatalyst Partners financial analysis of the $196 per share cash consideration to be offered to LinkedIn stockholders in the proposed merger. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini described the principal terms of the proposed merger agreement between LinkedIn and Microsoft. The LinkedIn Board then discussed potential reasons for, and risks inherent in, entering into an agreement for an acquisition with Microsoft, including, among other things, (1) the fact that the merger agreement permits the LinkedIn Board to consider, negotiate and accept an unsolicited superior proposal from Party A or other potential third parties and terminate the Companys agreement with Microsoft, subject to payment of the termination fee; (2) the potential of Party As willingness to continue to make acquisition proposals; (3) the need for Party A to obtain approval from its stockholders to consummate a transaction; (4) the value of and the certainty of value in the cash consideration offered by Microsoft and the cash and stock consideration proposed by Party A; (5) the current and prospective future state of credit markets; (6) the execution risks involved in negotiating and finalizing a merger agreement with Party A (versus the already negotiated merger agreement with Microsoft); and (7) the risks that Microsoft might not continue to pursue an acquisition of the Company after the expiration of the exclusivity period if a merger agreement were not executed by that time. Each of the members of the Transactions Committee discussed with the other members of the LinkedIn Board his views regarding the proposals and the process to date. Each of the members of the Transactions Committee noted that he was in favor of proceeding with Microsofts proposal before the lapse of exclusivity, particularly in light of (1) the value of Microsofts all-cash proposal; and (2) the execution risks and value of Party As proposal. Mr. Hoffman then stated that he believed that the proposed transaction with Microsoft

would be in the best interests of LinkedIns stockholders and that, as a stockholder, he would vote in favor of the transaction with Microsoft, subject to the LinkedIn Boards continued recommendation in favor of the transaction pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners then rendered Qatalyst Partners oral opinion to the LinkedIn Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 11, 2016, that, as of June 11, 2016, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of LinkedIn Class A common stock pursuant to the merger agreement (other than Microsoft or any affiliate of Microsoft), in their capacity as holders of LinkedIn Class A common stock, was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For more information about Qatalyst Partners opinion, see the section of this proxy statement captioned Fairness Opinion of Qatalyst Partners.  After further discussion, the LinkedIn Board unanimously (1) determined that it was in the best interests of LinkedIn and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by LinkedIn, the performance by LinkedIn of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; (3) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of LinkedIn; and (4) resolved to recommend that LinkedIn stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Mr. Weiner then informed the members of the LinkedIn Board that Microsoft had indicated a desire to begin discussion and negotiation of an employment arrangement with him prior to announcement of a transaction and the LinkedIn Board acquiesced to such discussions taking place.
 
Later on June 11, 2016, LinkedIn informed Microsoft that the LinkedIn Board had approved the acquisition, and the merger agreement was signed.
 
On June 13, 2016, prior to the opening of trading of the Class A common stock on the NYSE, LinkedIn and Microsoft issued a joint press release announcing the entry into the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the LinkedIn Board and Reasons for the Merger
 
Recommendation of the LinkedIn Board
 
The LinkedIn Board has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on and subject to the conditions set forth therein, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of LinkedIn and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in all respects.
 
The LinkedIn Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) FOR the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) FOR the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) FOR the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.
 
Reasons for the Merger
 
In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the LinkedIn Board consulted with LinkedIn management, its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel.  In recommending that LinkedIn stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement, the LinkedIn Board considered a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 
·                  LinkedIns business operations and management.
 
·                  LinkedIns historical and projected financial performance, results and condition, including the risks associated with achieving the Forecasts, which we define below.
 
·                  LinkedIns competitive positioning and prospects as a stand-alone company.
 
·                  The fact that the all-cash merger consideration will provide certainty of value to LinkedIn stockholders, while eliminating the effect of long-term business and execution risk.
 
·                  The oral opinion delivered by Qatalyst Partners to the LinkedIn Board on June 11, 2016, and subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of June 11, 2016, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the $196.00 per share merger consideration to be received by the Class A holders pursuant to the merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such Class A holders, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerFairness Opinion of Qatalyst Partners
 
·                  The relationship of the $196.00 per share merger consideration to the trading price of the common stock, including that the $196.00 per share merger consideration constituted a premium of approximately 49.5% to the closing price of the common stock on June 10, 2016, the last trading day prior to the date on which LinkedIn entered into the merger agreement.
 
·                  The reports of the Transactions Committee received by the LinkedIn Board regarding the process conducted by the Transactions Committee.
 
·                  Based on its review of the process conducted by the Transactions Committee, the LinkedIn Boards belief that $196.00 per share in cash and the terms of the merger agreement offer the best value reasonably attainable for LinkedIn stockholders.

Table of Contents
 
·                  The LinkedIn Boards view that the merger agreement was the product of arms-length negotiation and contained customary terms and conditions.
 
·                  The terms of the merger agreement, including:
 
·                  LinkedIns ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties regarding unsolicited acquisition proposals;
 
·                  The LinkedIn Boards view that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from making a superior proposal, including the merger agreements terms and conditions as they relate to company board recommendation changes (see the sections of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementNo Solicitation of Other Offers and The Merger AgreementThe LinkedIn Boards Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change);
 
·                  LinkedIns ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept an unsolicited superior proposal, subject to paying Microsoft a termination fee of $725 million and the other conditions of the merger agreement;
 
·                  The fact that the LinkedIn Board believed that the termination fee of $725 million, which is approximately 2.58% of LinkedIns implied equity value in the merger, is reasonable, consistent with or below fees in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers;
 
·                  LinkedIns entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement; and
 
·                  That the consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing condition.
 
·                  Potential acquirors of LinkedIn and various considerations associated with each such acquiror.
 
·                  The perceived risk of continuing as a stand-alone public company or pursuing other strategic alternatives.
 
·                  The fact that the Transactions Committee unanimously recommended the merger to the LinkedIn Board.
 
·                  Mr. Hoffmans support of the merger as being in the best interests of LinkedIn stockholders and that, as such, he intended to vote in favor of the merger in his capacity as a stockholder (subject to the LinkedIn Boards continuing recommendation of the merger).
 
·                  The LinkedIn Boards fiduciary duties in light of the foregoing.
 
The LinkedIn Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 
·                  The fact that the announcement and pendency of the merger, or the failure to complete the merger, may cause substantial harm to LinkedIns relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other personnel), vendors and customers, and may divert employees attention away from LinkedIns day-to-day business operations.
 
·                  The fact that LinkedIn stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of LinkedIn and will not benefit from any appreciations in value of LinkedIn, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of the combination of LinkedIn with Microsoft.
 
·                  The fact that, without the support of Mr. Hoffman, the merger could not be approved by LinkedIn stockholders.
 
47





Table of Contents
 
·                  The requirement that LinkedIn pay Microsoft a termination fee of $725 million under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if (1) the LinkedIn Board terminates the merger agreement to accept an unsolicited superior proposal or (2) if the merger agreement is not adopted by LinkedIn stockholders.
 
·                  The restrictions on the conduct of LinkedIns business prior to the consummation of the merger, including the requirement that LinkedIn conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent LinkedIn from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the merger and that, absent the merger agreement, LinkedIn might have pursued.
 
·                  The fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to LinkedIn stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
·                  The fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, LinkedIn is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger.
 
·                  The significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger, and the substantial time and effort of LinkedIn management required to complete the merger, which may disrupt LinkedIns business operations.
 
·                  The fact that LinkedIns business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the merger is not consummated.
 
·                  The risk that the merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of the termination of the merger agreement on the trading price of the Class A common stock.
 
·                  The fact that the completion of the merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and regulatory approval from the European Union and Canada.
 
·                  The fact that LinkedIns directors and officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other LinkedIn stockholders (see the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger).
 
The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by the LinkedIn Board in its consideration of the merger.  After considering these and other factors, the LinkedIn Board concluded that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks.  In view of the variety of factors considered by the LinkedIn Board and the complexity of these factors, the LinkedIn Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations.  Moreover, each member of the LinkedIn Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors.  The LinkedIn Board unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommends that LinkedIn stockholders adopt the merger agreement based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by the LinkedIn Board.

Fairness Opinion of Qatalyst Partners
 
LinkedIn retained Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor to the LinkedIn Board in connection with a potential transaction such as the merger and to evaluate whether the per share merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Class A common stock, in their capacity as Class A holders, pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Class A holders. LinkedIn selected Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business of LinkedIn and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of the Qatalyst Partners opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the LinkedIn Board on June 11, 2016, Qatalyst Partners rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be received by the Class A holders pursuant to the merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Class A holders. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated June 11, 2016, to the LinkedIn Board following the meeting of the LinkedIn Board.
 
The full text of Qatalyst Partners written opinion to the LinkedIn Board, dated June 11, 2016, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners opinion was provided to the LinkedIn Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be received by the Class A holders pursuant to the merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Class A common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices at which the Class A common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
 
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the merger agreement, certain related documents, and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of LinkedIn. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to LinkedIn prepared by the management of LinkedIn, including financial projections and operating data prepared by the management of LinkedIn, which we refer to as the LinkedIn Projections, which are described in more detail below in the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger  Financial Forecasts. Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of LinkedIn with senior executives of LinkedIn. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for the Class A common stock and compared the financial performance of LinkedIn and the prices and trading activity of the Class A common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.
 
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by LinkedIn. With respect to the LinkedIn Projections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by the management of LinkedIn, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the LinkedIn Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of LinkedIn of the future financial performance of LinkedIn and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on LinkedIn or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or

appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of LinkedIn, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of LinkedIn management as to the existing and future technology and products of LinkedIn and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.
 
Qatalyst Partners opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, June 11, 2016. Events occurring after such date may affect Qatalyst Partners opinion and the assumptions used in preparing the opinion, and Qatalyst Partners does not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the opinion. Qatalyst Partners opinion does not address the underlying business decision of LinkedIn to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to LinkedIn. Qatalyst Partners opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be received by the Class A holders pursuant to the merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders, and Qatalyst Partners expresses no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of LinkedIns officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration. Qatalyst Partners also expresses no opinion regarding the consideration to be received by any holder of Class B common stock under the merger agreement in such holders capacity as a holder of Class B common stock.
 
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated June 11, 2016. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts projections for LinkedIn, which we refer to as the Analyst Projections, as well as the LinkedIn Projections. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners financial analyses.
 
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
 
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a potential, present value of share values for the Class A common stock as of March 31, 2016 by:
 
·                  adding:
 
·                  the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of LinkedIn, based on the LinkedIn Projections, for the second through fourth quarters of calendar year 2016, and for calendar year 2017 through calendar year 2019 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 10.0% to 13.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for LinkedIn);
 
·                  the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of LinkedIn, calculated by multiplying the estimated Adjusted EBITDA (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerFinancial Forecasts), less any capitalized software and website development costs (excluding capitalized stock-based compensation), which we refer to as the estimated Modified EBITDA, in calendar year 2020, based on the LinkedIn Projections, by a range of multiples of fully-diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated Modified EBITDA of 12.0x to 18.0x and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in the first bullet above;
 
·                  the implied net present value of LinkedIns forecasted tax attributes outstanding at the end of calendar year 2020, based on the LinkedIn Projections (which implied present value was calculated by using the same range of discount rates used in the first bullet above); and

·                  LinkedIns cash net of the face value of outstanding convertible notes and book value of minority interests, as provided by LinkedIn management as of March 31, 2016;
 
·                  applying a dilution factor of approximately 12%, as projected by LinkedIn management, to reflect the dilution to current stockholders over the projection period due to the effect of future equity compensation grants; and
 
·                  dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, adjusted for restricted stock units and stock options outstanding as of March 31, 2016, as provided by LinkedIn management.
 
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for the shares of common stock of $156.43 to $238.39 per share.
 
Selected Companies Analysis
 
Qatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for LinkedIn with publicly available information and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in this comparison were the companies listed below and were selected because they are publicly traded companies in LinkedIns industry.

diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus Modified EBITDA for calendar year 2017, which we refer to as the CY17E Modified EBITDA Multiples, for each of the selected consumer internet companies. The median CY17E Modified EBITDA Multiple for the selected consumer internet companies analyzed was 13.4x.
 
Based on an analysis of the CY17E Modified EBITDA Multiples for each of the selected consumer internet companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 12.0x to 18.0x and applied this range to LinkedIns calendar year 2017 estimated Modified EBITDA based on each of the Analyst Projections and the LinkedIn Projections. Based on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2016, as provided by LinkedIn management, adjusted for restricted stock units and stock options outstanding as of May 31, 2016, as provided by LinkedIn management, this analysis implied a range of values for the shares of common stock of approximately $122.35 to $176.71 per share based on the LinkedIn Projections, and approximately $110.46 to $158.89 per share based on the Analyst Projections.
 
Based upon research analyst consensus estimates for calendar year 2017, and using the closing prices as of June 10, 2016, for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied fully diluted enterprise value divided by estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2017, which we refer to as the CY17E Revenue Multiples, for each of the selected SaaS companies. The median CY17E Revenue Multiple for the selected software as a service, or SaaS, companies analyzed was 6.2x.
 
Based on an analysis of the CY17E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected SaaS companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 4.0x to 7.0x and applied this range to LinkedIns calendar year 2017 estimated revenue based on each of the Analyst Projections and the LinkedIn Projections. Based on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2016, as provided by LinkedIn management, adjusted for restricted stock units and stock options outstanding as of May 31, 2016, as provided by LinkedIn management, this analysis implied a range of values for the shares of common stock of approximately $142.17 to $238.26 per share based on the LinkedIn Projections, and approximately $137.75 to $230.58 per share based on the Analyst Projections.
 
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to LinkedIn. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to (1) industry performance; (2) general business, economic, market and financial conditions; and (3) other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control of LinkedIn, such as (1) the impact of competition on the business of LinkedIn and the industry in general; (2) industry growth; and (3) the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of LinkedIn or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.

For each of the SaaS transactions listed above, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of analyst estimates of the next-twelve-months revenue of the target company, which we refer to as the NTM Revenue Multiples, as reflected in certain publicly available financial statements, research analyst reports and press releases.
 
Based on the analysis of the NTM Revenue Multiples for the transactions noted above, Qatalyst Partners applied an NTM Revenue Multiple range of 5.0x to 9.0x to LinkedIns estimated next-twelve-months revenue based on Analyst Projections and calculated for the 12 month period ending on March 31, 2017. This analysis implied a range of values for the Shares of approximately $149.41 to $257.96.
 
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to LinkedIn or the merger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of LinkedIn, such as (1) the impact of competition on the business of LinkedIn or the industry generally; (2) industry growth; and (3) the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition of LinkedIn or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the merger, Qatalyst Partners cautions against placing undue reliance on this information.
 
Miscellaneous
 
In connection with the review of the merger by the LinkedIn Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst Partners view of the actual value of LinkedIn. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of LinkedIn. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
 
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be received by the Class A holders pursuant to the merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to the LinkedIn Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which the shares of Class A common stock might actually trade.
 
Qatalyst Partners opinion and its presentation to the LinkedIn Board was one of many factors considered by the LinkedIn Board in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the LinkedIn Board with respect to the per share merger consideration to be received by the Class A holders pursuant to the merger agreement, in their capacity as Class A holders, or of whether the LinkedIn Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The per share merger consideration was

Table of Contents
 
determined through arms-length negotiations between LinkedIn and Microsoft and was approved by the LinkedIn Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to LinkedIn during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to LinkedIn or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
 
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of LinkedIn, Microsoft or certain of their respective affiliates. During the two year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and LinkedIn or Microsoft pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to LinkedIn and Microsoft and their respective affiliates for which it or they would expect to receive compensation.
 
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided LinkedIn with financial advisory services in connection with a contemplated sale of LinkedIn, which includes the merger, and for which it will be paid approximately $55 million, $250,000 of which was payable upon the execution of its engagement letter, $7.5 million of which became payable upon delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation of the merger. LinkedIn has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. LinkedIn has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses relating to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners engagement.
 
Financial Forecasts
 
LinkedIn does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings, or other results. However, LinkedIn management has prepared the prospective financial information set forth below to provide financial forecasts to both Qatalyst Partners and Microsoft in connection with Microsofts acquisition of LinkedIn. We refer to the forecasts for 2016 to 2020 as the Forecasts.
 
The accompanying prospective financial information were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of LinkedIn management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of LinkedIn managements knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of LinkedIn. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.
 
Neither LinkedIns independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.
 
Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the Forecasts set forth below. Although the Forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, the Forecasts reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by LinkedIn management that they believed were reasonable at the time the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to LinkedIn management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not to be achieved include (1) general economic conditions; (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (4) competitive pressures; and (5) changes in tax laws. In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Forecasts. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the LinkedIn Board, LinkedIn or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Forecasts to be predictive of actual future results. The Forecasts are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any LinkedIn stockholder to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. LinkedIn does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Adjusted EBITDA and Modified EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. LinkedIn uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. LinkedIn

Table of Contents
 
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP financial measures included by LinkedIn in the Forecasts are defined and reconciled to GAAP financial measures below.
 
Adjusted EBITDA
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus: provision for income taxes; other (income) expense, net; depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation.
 
LinkedIn included adjusted EBITDA in the Forecasts because it is a key measure used by LinkedIn management and the LinkedIn Board to understand and evaluate LinkedIns core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve LinkedIns annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of LinkedIns core business. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of the LinkedIn Board in connection with the payment of bonuses to our executive officers and employees. Accordingly, LinkedIn believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating LinkedIns projections in the same manner as LinkedIn management and the LinkedIn Board.
 
LinkedIns use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, LinkedIns working capital needs; adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and other companies, including companies in LinkedIns industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.
 
Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other US GAAP results.
 
Modified EBITDA
 
Modified EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus: provision for income taxes; other (income) expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; and capitalized software and website costs.
 
LinkedIn included modified EBITDA in the Forecasts because it provided another measure by which to evaluate LinkedIns core operating performance and trends. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating modified EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of LinkedIns core business. Accordingly, LinkedIn believes that modified EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating LinkedIns projections in the same manner as LinkedIn management and the LinkedIn Board used it in evaluating the transaction.
 
LinkedIns use of modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and modified EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, LinkedIns working capital needs; modified EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; modified EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and other companies, including companies in LinkedIns industry, may calculate modified EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider modified EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other US GAAP results.
 
Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income
 
The Forecasts include a forecast of LinkedIns adjusted EBITDA.

Interests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
 
When considering the recommendation of the LinkedIn Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of LinkedIn stockholders generally, as more fully described below.  The LinkedIn Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by LinkedIns stockholders.
 
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
 
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger Agreement  Indemnification and Insurance.
 
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
 
Treatment of Company Options
 
As of the record date, there were [·] outstanding company options held by our directors and executive officers, of which [·] have an exercise price below $196.00 per share.
 
Each surrendered company option will, as of the effective time of the merger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $196.00 for each share of LinkedIn common stock that would have

Table of Contents
 
been issuable upon exercise of such surrendered company option prior to the effective time of the merger less the applicable exercise price for each such share of LinkedIn common stock under such surrendered company option and less any applicable withholding taxes.  If the per share exercise price of any surrendered company option is equal to or greater than $196.00, such surrendered company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the merger for no payment and will have no further effect.
 
Each assumed company option will, as of the effective time of the merger, be, as determined by Microsoft, (1) assumed by Microsoft and converted into an option to acquire; or (2) converted into an option granted pursuant to the Microsoft stock plan, to acquire, in each case, on the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such assumed company option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, a number of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (1) the number of shares of LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company option as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (2) the stock award exchange ratio.  The per share exercise price for assumed company options will equal the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing the (1) per share exercise price for the LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company option as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by (2) the stock award exchange ratio.  Each company option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than $196.00 and is not a surrendered company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the merger for no payment and will have no further effect.
 
Prior to the closing date of the merger, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all company options that would otherwise be assumed company options as vested surrendered company options, which will become fully vested and then cancelled and treated in accordance with the above.
 
In addition, each executive officer is eligible to receive immediate vesting of 100% or 50%, as applicable, of his or her outstanding company options, under his or her offer letter or change of control agreement if, within 12 months following the merger, there is an involuntary termination of employment without cause, or a constructive termination.
 
For purposes of the merger agreement, the stock award exchange ratio means a fraction, the numerator of which is $196.00 and the denominator of which is the volume weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts 0.00005 and above rounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the complete trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date of the merger.
 
Treatment of Company Stock-Based Awards
 
As of the record date, there were [·] outstanding RSUs held by our directors and executive officers.  Our directors and officers do not hold any other type of company stock-based award.
 
Each surrendered company stock-based award will, as of the effective time of the merger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $196.00 with respect to each share of LinkedIn common stock subject to the surrendered company-stock based award, less any applicable withholding taxes.
 
Non-employee directors of LinkedIn are not expected to continue as directors after the merger, and pursuant to the terms of the LinkedIn 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as a result of not continuing as a director after the merger, the 3,102 RSUs each held by A. George Skip Battle, Leslie Kilgore and Stanley Meresman will vest in connection with the merger and such individuals will receive the cash payment for surrendered company stock-based awards described in the above paragraph with respect to the shares subject to their RSUs.

Table of Contents
 
Each assumed company stock-based award will, as of the effective time of the merger, be, as determined by Microsoft, (1) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award; or (2) converted into a stock-based award granted pursuant to the Microsoft stock plan, in each case with the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such assumed company stock-based award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, in respect of a number of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (1) the number of shares of LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company stock-based award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (2) the stock award exchange ratio.
 
Prior to the closing date of the merger, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all company stock-based awards that would otherwise be assumed company stock-based awards as vested surrendered company stock-based awards, which will become fully vested and then cancelled and treated in accordance with the above.
 
In addition, each executive officer is eligible to receive immediate vesting of 100% or 50%, as applicable, of his or her outstanding RSUs, under his or her offer letter or change of control agreement if, within 12 months following the merger, there is an involuntary termination of employment without cause, or a constructive termination, as described more fully below.
 
Equity Interests of LinkedIns Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors
 
The following table sets forth for each LinkedIn executive officer and director, as of June 15, 2016, (1) the number of shares of common stock held; (2) the number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding and vested company options with an exercise price less than $196.00 per share; (3) the number of shares of common stock subject to unvested company options with an exercise price less than $196.00 per share that will vest upon a qualifying termination of employment; and (4) the number of shares of common stock subject to underlying RSUs that will vest in connection with the merger or upon a qualifying termination of employment.  The table sets forth the values of these shares and equity awards based on the $196.00 per share merger consideration (minus the applicable exercise price for the company options).
 
In connection with the merger, LinkedIn intends to grant Jeffrey Weiner a company stock-based award in the form of RSUs with the number of RSUs determined by dividing $7,000,000 by the per share merger consideration as of the closing of the merger, which we refer to as the Weiner Retention Grant.  The Weiner Retention Grant will be granted immediately prior to the closing of the merger and will be subject to Mr. Weiners continued employment with LinkedIn through and including the date of grant.  The Weiner Retention Grant will be scheduled to vest on the earlier of (1) the one year anniversary of the closing date of the merger and (2) December 31, 2017, and will be subject to the severance provisions (including as to equity acceleration) set forth in Mr. Weiners offer letter, as described more fully below.  Even though the Weiner Retention Grant will not be granted until immediately prior to the closing of the merger, it is included in the table below.

·                  a lump-sum payment payable on the 60th day following termination of employment equal to 12 months of his base salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination, or, if greater, the rate in effect immediately prior to the change of control;
 
·                  a lump-sum payment payable on the 60th day following termination of employment equal to Mr. Weiners annual target bonus (corporate and individual performance components at 100% of annual target) for the year of termination, or, if greater, Mr. Weiners annual target bonus in effect immediately prior to the change of control;

Employment Arrangements Following the Merger
 
Microsoft Offer Letter with Jeffrey Weiner
 
On June 14, 2016, Mr. Weiner and Microsoft entered into an offer letter, which we refer to as the Microsoft Offer Letter, which provides that upon and subject to the closing of the merger, Mr. Weiner will be employed as Chief Executive Officer of the LinkedIn Group of Microsoft and Executive Vice President-Microsoft.  The Microsoft Offer Letter provides that Mr. Weiners starting annual salary will be $815,000 and Mr. Weiner will receive an on-hire performance stock award, which we refer to as the On-Hire PSA, for shares of Microsoft common stock.  The target number of shares subject to the On-Hire PSA will be calculated by dividing $25,000,000 by the closing price of Microsoft common stock on Mr. Weiners start date and will be allocated among four performance periods as follows, in the percentages below:
 
·                  the closing of the merger through December 31, 2017  28.5% of the target number of shares;
 
·                  January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018  14.5% of the target number of shares;
 
·                  Microsoft fiscal year 2019 (July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019)  28.5% of the target number of shares; and
 
·                  Microsoft fiscal year 2020 (July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020)  28.5% of the target number of shares.
 
Mr. Weiner may vest in and be issued between 0% and 250% of the target number of shares subject to the On-Hire PSA allocated to a performance period based on performance against goals set for the period.  Vesting of the award for each performance period is contingent on Mr. Weiners continued employment through the last day of that performance period.
 
Additionally, Mr. Weiner will be eligible to participate in Microsofts Executive Incentive Program, which we refer to as the EIP, which is comprised of the following three components:
 
·                  annual cash award target of 250% of salary earned during the fiscal year, with an actual cash award ranging from 0-200% of target, with Mr. Weiners first EIP cash award opportunity prorated based upon his fiscal year base salary from the later to occur of his start date or January 1, 2017;
 
·                  a stock award, on an annualized basis, equal to $4,250,000, with the number of Microsoft shares calculated by dividing the award value by the closing Microsoft stock price on August 31 of the award year (if Mr. Weiners start date is prior to April 1, 2017, he will receive a full award for fiscal year 2017, 25% of which will vest on August 31, 2017 and 12.5% of which will vest each six month thereafter); and
 
·                  a performance stock award, on an annualized basis, with a target equal to $4,250,000 and with the number of Microsoft shares calculated by dividing the award value by the closing Microsoft stock price on August 31 of the award year (if Mr. Weiners start date is prior to April 1, 2017, he will receive a full award for fiscal year 2017).  The number of shares actually awarded may be up to 400% of the target award.

Table of Contents
 
In addition, Mr. Weiner will continue to be eligible for 2016 incentive compensation under LinkedIns Executive Compensation Bonus Plan with adjustments to the performance metrics if the closing of the merger occurs before December 31, 2016. If Mr. Weiners start date occurs before January 1, 2017, Mr. Weiner will receive his EIP cash award target of 250% of his salary in lieu of the target set in the LinkedIn Executive Compensation Bonus Plan for the period from his start date to December 31, 2016. If, however, his start date occurs after December 31, 2016, he will remain eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus for the 2017 calendar year under the LinkedIn Executive Compensation Bonus Plan covering the period from January 1, 2017 until his start date.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Mr. Weiner will receive Microsoft stock awards for his unvested LinkedIn stock awards, which we refer to as assumed stock awards, and stock options in exchange for his unvested, in-the-money LinkedIn stock options, which we refer to as the assumed options.
 
Effective from his start date with Microsoft, Mr. Weiner will no longer participate in any LinkedIn severance program, including the severance arrangements described in his LinkedIn offer letter.  Instead, Mr. Weiner will participate in Microsofts Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan, which we refer to as the SESBP.  Under the SESBP, a participant will receive severance payments and benefits if the participants employment is terminated by Microsoft without cause (as such term is defined in the SESBP).  These payments and benefits consist of (1) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to one times annual base salary plus target annual cash award under the EIP, payable within 60 days after the termination date; (2) pro-rata payment of the participants annual cash award under the EIP which amount is payable at the time annual cash awards for the year are paid to other EIP participants; (3) vesting of the portion of stock awards that would otherwise vest in the 12 months after termination of employment; (4) vesting of a pro-rata portion of any performance stock awards (including the On-Hire PSAs) provided that at least one year of the performance period has been completed as of the termination date and the pro-rated vesting applies to the lesser of (1) the number of shares earned based on achievement of performance goals and (2) the target number of shares under the award agreement; (5) payment of COBRA premiums for up to 6 months; and (6) up to 12 months of outplacement assistance. There is no change-in-control provision in the SESBP. To receive the severance payments and benefits, Mr. Weiner is required to execute a separation agreement that includes a release of claims, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12 month non-solicitation restrictions.
 
If within 12 months following the closing of the merger, Mr. Weiners employment is involuntarily terminated by Microsoft without cause or he resigns as a result of a constructive termination, then, upon either of such events, Mr. Weiner will be entitled to immediate vesting of 100% of both the assumed options and assumed stock awards that are unvested as of the date of such termination or resignation.  In addition, if, within 12 months following the closing of the merger, Mr. Weiner resigns as a result of a constructive termination, Mr. Weiner will receive a lump sum payment on the 60th day following such resignation equal to the sum of (1) 12 months of base salary at the rate in effect on the date of his resignation or, if greater, the rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger; and (2) Mr. Weiners annual target bonus at 100% of annual target for the year of resignation or, if greater, Mr. Weiners annual target bonus in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger.
 
If more than 12 months following the closing of the merger Mr. Weiners employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, as defined in the SESBP, then upon such termination Mr. Weiner will be entitled to continued vesting of his assumed options and assumed stock awards on the same vesting schedule that would have applied if his employment continued through the relevant vest dates.
 
For the purposes of the SESBP, the term cause means:
 
·                  being convicted or pleading guilty or no contest to (a) any felony or (b) a misdemeanor charge involving fraud, false statements or misleading omissions, wrongful taking, embezzlement, bribery, forgery, counterfeiting or extortion;
 
·                  engaging in gross misconduct;
 
·                  repeatedly failing to substantially perform duties after notice and an opportunity to cure, provided those duties are consistent with Mr. Weiners seniority;
 
·                  violating any securities laws, rules or regulations, or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or association of which Microsoft or any of its affiliates is a member; or
 
67





Table of Contents
 
·                  violating Microsofts policies designed to prevent violations of law, such as, without limitation, policies pertaining to compliance with the laws prohibiting unlawful discrimination, harassment, or insider trading.
 
For the purposes of the Microsoft Offer letter, the term cause means Mr. Weiner:
 
·                  engaging in knowing and intentional illegal conduct that was or is materially injurious to Microsoft or its affiliates;
 
·                  violating a federal or state law or regulation applicable to Microsofts business which violation was or is reasonably likely to be injurious to Microsoft;
 
·                  materially breaching the terms of any confidentiality agreement or invention assignment agreement with LinkedIn or Microsoft;
 
·                  being convicted of, or entering a plea of nolo contendere to, a felony or committing any act of moral turpitude, dishonesty or fraud against, or the misappropriation of material property belonging to, Microsoft or its affiliates.
 
For the purposes of the Microsoft Offer Letter, the term constructive termination means, without Mr. Weiners written consent:
 
·                  a reduction in base salary, other than a reduction in salary that is part of an expense reduction effort applied to the executive management team (defined as Microsofts CEO and his executive direct reports) generally and which results in a percentage reduction of salary or bonus no greater than the greatest percentage reduction applied to at least one other member of the executive management team;
 
·                  a relocation of the principal place of work to a location more than 35 miles away from the workplace prior to the relocation; or
 
·                  a significant reduction of duties or responsibilities when compared to duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger.  However, if Mr. Weiner (1) reports to the Microsoft CEO following the closing of the merger, (2) continues to be Chief Executive Officer of the LinkedIn business, and (3) retains responsibility for managing the day-to-day operations of the LinkedIn business (even if Mr. Weiner has the title described in the Microsoft Offer Letter and does not report to or interact with the Microsoft Board of Directors), such arrangements shall not be considered a constructive termination under the foregoing.
 
Any payments or benefits, including the accelerated vesting of Mr. Weiners assumed options and assumed stock awards, in connection with an involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination (whether before or after the date that is 12 months following the closing of the merger) will be contingent on Mr. Weiners execution, delivery and non-revocation of a separation and release agreement in the form provided by Microsoft substantially in the form used under the SESBP.
 
Other Executives
 
Except as described above, as of the date of this proxy statement, none of LinkedIns other executive officers have reached an understanding on potential employment with Microsoft or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Microsoft, and except as described above, no LinkedIn executive officers have entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment with Microsoft or other retention with the surviving corporation or with Microsoft following the consummation of the merger.  However, prior to the effective time of the merger, Microsoft

may initiate discussions regarding employment or other retention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of LinkedIns employees, to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.  In addition, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementEmployee Benefits, Microsoft has agreed to honor all of the employee plans (including the offer letters and change of control agreements with the executives) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
 
Golden Parachute Compensation
 
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the merger.  The amounts in the table below will or may become payable to the named executive officers only in the event they are terminated within 12 months following the merger.  Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this compensation.
 
LinkedIns named executive officers for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Weiner, Sordello, Callahan, Gamson and Scott.  The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K published by the SEC regarding certain compensation that each of LinkedIns named executive officers may receive that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the merger.  The figures in the table are estimated based on (1) compensation and benefit levels as of June 15, 2016; (2) an assumed effective date of December 15, 2016, for the merger; and (3) the termination of the named executive officers employment without cause on the day immediately following such effective date for the merger.  The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date.  Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set below.
 
The values in the table below payable to Mr. Weiner by Microsoft are not subject to the non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to LinkedIns named executive officers in connection with the merger.  LinkedIns executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax reimbursement in connection with the merger.
 
As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of LinkedIns common stock have been calculated based on the per share merger consideration.

(2)         As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerEmployment Arrangements Following the MergerOffer Letter with Jeffrey Weiner, pursuant to the terms of the Microsoft Offer Letter and following the completion of the merger, Mr. Weiner will be a participant in the SESBP, and will be eligible to receive cash severance benefits upon a termination without cause consisting of: (1) a lump-sum payment equal to one times annual base salary plus target annual cash award under the EIP payable within 60 days of the termination date; and (2) a pro-rata payment of Mr. Weiners annual target cash award under the EIP, which amount is payable at the time annual cash awards for the year are paid to other EIP participants.  To receive these double-trigger severance payments, Mr. Weiner is required to execute a separation agreement that includes a release of claims, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12 month non-solicitation restrictions.
 
In addition, if within 12 months following the closing of the merger, Mr. Weiner resigns as a result of a constructive termination, Mr. Weiner will receive a lump sum payment on the 60th day following such resignation equal to the sum of (1) 12 months of base salary as the rate in effect on the date of his resignation or, if greater, the rate in effect immediately prior to the closing; and (2) Mr. Weiners annual target bonus at 100% of annual target for the year of resignation or, if greater, Mr. Weiners annual target bonus in effect immediately prior to the closing.  Payment of such double-trigger severance will be conditioned on Mr. Weiner executing and not revoking a release of claims substantially in the form used under the SESBP that includes a release of claims, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12 month non-solicitation restrictions.
 
For purposes of this disclosure we have assumed Mr. Weiners employment is terminated without cause one day following the closing of the merger.

Assuming Mr. Weiners employment is terminated one day following the closing of the merger, he will only be entitled to receive the value of the Microsoft Cash. As noted above, in the Microsoft Offer Letter, Mr. Weiner agreed to waive any severance payments and benefits he may be entitled to receive pursuant to his offer letter with LinkedIn and, accordingly, would not be entitled to the value of the LinkedIn Cash.
 
(3)         As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerPayments upon Termination Following Change of Control, under the applicable offer letter or change of control agreement, 100% (in the case of Messrs. Weiner, Sordello and Callahan) or 50% (in the case of Messrs. Gamson and Scott) of the named executive officers outstanding equity awards will vest upon a qualifying termination of employment, which we refer to as the equity acceleration.  Messrs. Weiner and Sordello will receive the equity acceleration if, within 12 months following a change of control (including the merger), their employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or the individual is constructively terminated.  Each of Messrs. Callahan, Gamson and Scott will receive the equity acceleration if, within 12 months following a change of control (including the merger), the individuals employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or their employment is constructively terminated and the individual chooses to resign within a reasonable period of time following such constructive termination.  The value of acceleration of the company options is calculated by multiplying the number of accelerated company options by the difference between the per share merger consideration and the exercise price.  The value of the RSUs is based on the number of the accelerated unvested shares, multiplied by the per share merger consideration.  The following table quantifies the value of equity awards that accelerate upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the merger.  All such amounts are double-trigger and are conditioned on the named executive officer signing and not revoking the then current standard form of release.

(4)         In connection with the merger, LinkedIn intends to grant Jeffrey Weiner the Weiner Retention Grant.  The Weiner Retention Grant will be granted immediately prior to the closing of the merger, subject to Mr. Weiners continued employment with LinkedIn through and including the date of grant.  The Weiner Retention Grant will be scheduled to vest on the earlier of (1) the one year anniversary of the closing date of the merger and (2) December 31, 2017, and will be subject to the severance provisions (including as to equity acceleration) set forth in Mr. Weiners offer letter, as described more fully above.  Even though the Weiner Retention Grant will not become effective until shortly before the closing of the merger, it is included in the Golden Parachute Compensation table.
 
(5)         As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerEmployment Arrangements Following the MergerOffer Letter with Jeffrey Weiner, if within 12 months following the closing of the merger, Mr. Weiners employment is involuntarily terminated by Microsoft without cause or he resigns as a result of a constructive termination, then, upon either of such events, Mr. Weiner will be entitled to immediate vesting of 100% of the assumed options, assumed stock awards, and the Weiner Retention Grant that are unvested as of the date of such termination or resignation.  The accelerated vesting of Mr. Weiners assumed options and assumed stock awards, in connection with an involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination (whether before or after the date that is 12 months following the closing of the merger) will be contingent on Mr. Weiners execution, delivery and non-revocation of a separation and release agreement in the form provided by Microsoft substantially in the form used under the SESBP that includes a

release of claims, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12 month non-solicitation restrictions.  For purposes of this disclosure, we are assuming (1) the value of the acceleration of the assumed options, assumed stock awards and Weiner Retention Grant, each a double-trigger benefit, equals the value of the awards reflected in the LinkedIn Equity column; (2) the On-Hire PSAs, stock award and performance stock award were all granted on the date of the closing of the merger; (3) no portion of the On-Hire PSAs or performance stock awards will vest as a result of the termination in accordance with the terms of the SESBP; and (4) only 25% of the stock awards will vest as a result of the termination in accordance with the terms of the SESBP.
 
(6)         As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerPayments Upon Termination Following Change of Control, these amounts equal the value of 12 months payment of COBRA premiums for the named executive officer, his spouse and eligible dependents, which we refer to as the COBRA Benefits.  The COBRA Benefits are a double-trigger benefit and will be payable to Messrs. Weiner and Sordello if, within 12 months following a change of control (including the merger), their employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or the individual is constructively terminated.  The COBRA Benefits will be paid to each of Messrs. Callahan, Gamson and Scott if, within 12 months following a change of control (including the merger), the individuals employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or their employment is constructively terminated and the individual chooses to resign within a reasonable period of time following such constructive termination.  The receipt of the COBRA Benefits is conditioned on the named executive officer signing and not revoking the then current standard form of release.
 
(7)         As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerEmployment Arrangements Following the MergerOffer Letter with Jeffrey Weiner, pursuant to the terms of the Microsoft Offer Letter, Mr. Weiner will be a participant in the SESBP, and will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits upon a termination without cause: (1) six months of continued health care premiums under COBRA (valued at $9,258, assuming that Mr. Weiner chooses the highest level of coverage); and (2) 12 months of outplacement assistance (valued at $40,000).  To receive this double-trigger severance benefit, Mr. Weiner is required to execute a separation agreement that includes a release of claims, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12 month non-solicitation restrictions.
 
Assuming Mr. Weiners employment is terminated one day following the closing of the merger, he will only be entitled to receive the value of the Microsoft Perquisites / Benefits. As noted above, in the Microsoft Offer Letter, Mr. Weiner agreed to waive any severance payments and benefits he may be entitled to receive pursuant to his offer letter with LinkedIn and accordingly, would not be entitled to the value of the LinkedIn Perquisites / Benefits.
 
(8)         This amount represents the sum of the amounts in the LinkedIn Cash, LinkedIn Equity, and LinkedIn Perquisites / Benefits columns for each named executive officer.  For each named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officers employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or the individual is constructively terminated within 12 months of a change of control (including the merger) and the named executive officers receives severance payments and benefits pursuant to their offer letter or change of control agreement with LinkedIn, although as noted above, Mr. Weiner will be entitled to receive severance payments and benefits pursuant to the Microsoft Offer Letter.  For purposes of the non-binding, advisory vote, our stockholders are being asked to approve the payments to the named executive officers shown in this column.
 
(9)         This amount represents the sum of the amounts in the Microsoft Cash, Microsoft Equity, and Microsoft Perquisites / Benefits columns for Mr. Weiner.  The amount in this column assumes that Mr. Weiner receives severance payments and benefits pursuant to the Microsoft Offer Letter as described above and will not be eligible to receive severance or benefits under his LinkedIn offer letter.
 
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
 
The closing of the merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementConditions to the Closing of the Merger), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions, or such other time agreed to in writing by Microsoft, LinkedIn and Merger Sub.  Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL.  The merger will
 
72





Table of Contents
 
become effective upon the filing of and acceptance of such certificate of merger, or at such later time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.
 
Appraisal Rights
 
If the merger is consummated, LinkedIn stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly demand an appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as Section 262.  Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a stockholder are to a record holder of LinkedIn common stock.
 
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.  The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that LinkedIn stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.  Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holders name.  A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holders shares.  If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
 
Under Section 262, holders of record of shares of common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholders shares to LinkedIn prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.
 
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262.  This proxy statement constitutes LinkedIns notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.  In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holders right to do so, should review Annex C carefully.  Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.  A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement without interest.  Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, LinkedIn believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
 
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:
 
·                  the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
 
·                  the stockholder must deliver to LinkedIn a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting;
 
73





Table of Contents
 
·                  the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger); and
 
·                  a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger.  The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
 
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares.
 
Filing Written Demand
 
A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to LinkedIn, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting at which the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholders shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.  A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger.  A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholders right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.  Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement.  Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.  The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.  A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand.  A stockholders failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
 
Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holders name.  A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform LinkedIn of the identity of the holder state that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholders shares.  If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners.  An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
 
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.  A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
 
LinkedIn Corporation
2029 Stierlin Court
Mountain View, CA 94043
Attention: Corporate Secretary
 
Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to LinkedIn a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.  However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholders demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.
 
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
 
If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each record holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
 
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
 
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock.  Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.  The failure of a holder of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholders previous written demand for an appraisal of such stockholders shares.
 
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such holders shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which LinkedIn has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares.  The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.  A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such persons own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements.  As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
 
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached.  After
 
75





Table of Contents
 
notice to the stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder.  The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
 
Determination of Fair Value
 
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.  Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.  In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.  Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment.  In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court should be considered, and that [f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.  The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.  Section 262 provides that fair value is to be exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.  In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.  In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.
 
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although LinkedIn believes that the per share merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per share merger consideration.  Neither LinkedIn nor Microsoft anticipates offering more than the per share merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of LinkedIn and Microsoft reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the fair value of a share of common stock is less than the per share merger consideration.  If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease.  The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances.  Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
 
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holders right to appraisal, the stockholders shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share merger

consideration as provided in the merger agreement.  A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose such holders right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such holders demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share merger consideration as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.
 
From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger): provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholders demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholders demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation.
 
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholders statutory appraisal rights.  Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.
 
Accounting Treatment
 
The merger will be accounted for as a purchase transaction for financial accounting purposes.
 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
 
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger.  This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.  This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).
 
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances.  For example, this discussion does not address:
 
·                  tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and shareholders, partners or investors in such entities; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as qualified small business stock for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
·                  tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;

·                  tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.  Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
 
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described below.  If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.
 
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER.  A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
 
U.S. Holders
 
For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
·                  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
·                  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
·                  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 
·                  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  In general, such U.S. Holders gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger.  A U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares.  Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holders holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger.  A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals).  The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.  If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.
 
Non-U.S. Holders
 
For purposes of this discussion, the term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 
·                  the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
 
·                  such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or
 
·                  LinkedIn is or has been a United States real property holding corporation as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code, which we refer to as a USRPHC, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holders holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock, which we refer to as the relevant period, and, if shares of common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. We believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.
 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
 
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the merger.  Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (1) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holders non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.  Backup withholding is not an additional tax.  Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
 
General
 
LinkedIn and Microsoft have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.  These approvals include approval under, or notifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of the European Union and Canada.
 
In addition, each of LinkedIn and Microsoft have agreed to (1) cooperate and coordinate with each other to make such filings; (2) use its reasonable best efforts to supply the other with any information that may be required in order to make such filings; (3) use its reasonable best efforts to supply any additional information that reasonably may be requested to obtain regulatory approvals; (4) use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to obtain regulatory approvals as soon as practicable; and (5) provide notice to the other party if it plans to participate in any material meeting or substantive conversation with respect to the merger.
 
If and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Merger Sub and, solely to the extent requested by Microsoft, LinkedIn will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of LinkedIn; and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of the LinkedIn; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft is not obligated to  offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any action with respect to LinkedIn that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of LinkedIn. Microsoft is not required to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any action with respect to its business if taking such action would reasonably be expected to (1) have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or (2) have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its subsidiaries.
 
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
 
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until LinkedIn and Microsoft file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the FTC, and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the DOJ, under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.  A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period.  The DOJ or the FTC may extend the 30 day waiting period by issuing a Request for Additional Information (also known as a Second Request).  If either agency issues a Second Request, the waiting period is extended until 30 days after the parties substantially comply with the request.
 
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest.  Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.  Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

Foreign Competition Laws
 
LinkedIn and Microsoft conduct business in Member States of the European Union.  Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, as amended, and accompanying regulations require notification of and approval by the European Commission of mergers or acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and European Union sales exceeding given thresholds before these mergers and acquisitions can be implemented.  The parties will file a formal notification of the transaction with the European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable.
 
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, the European Commission has 25 business days from the day following the date of receipt of a complete notification, which period may be extended to 35 business days under certain circumstances, in which to consider whether the merger would significantly impede effective competition in the common market (as defined by European Community regulations) or a substantial part of it, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position. By the end of that period, the European Commission must issue a decision either clearing the merger, which may be conditional upon satisfaction of the parties undertakings, or opening an in-depth Phase II investigation.  A Phase II investigation may last a maximum of an additional 125 business days.  It is possible that an investigation could result in a challenge to the merger based on European Union competition law or regulations.
 
The completion of the merger is also subject to certain filing requirements and/or approvals under the competition laws of Canada.  The parties must also observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances or consents in the required foreign jurisdictions before completing the merger.  The parties will file merger notifications with the appropriate regulators in each of the required foreign jurisdictions as promptly as practicable and work cooperatively toward expedited regulatory clearances.
 
Other Regulatory Approvals
 
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger.  Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals.  There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by LinkedIn stockholders and the completion of the merger.
 
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement.  These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
 
We are asking you to approve the adoption of the merger agreement.  For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth under the sections of this proxy statement captioned The Merger and The Merger Agreement.  A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.  You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING
 
We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.  If stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement.  Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.  Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present, and the chair of the special meeting may also adjourn the special meeting for such purpose even if the stockholders have not approved the proposal to adjourn the special meeting.
 
The LinkedIn Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerGolden Parachute Compensation.
 
We are asking stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by LinkedIn to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.  These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers of in the MergerGolden Parachute Compensation and the accompanying footnotes.  In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of LinkedIns overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements.  These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the LinkedIn Board, which is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.  The compensation that may be provided to Jeffrey Weiner in connection with his new offer letter entered into with Microsoft is not subject to this advisory, non-binding vote.
 
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of LinkedIn Corporation approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to LinkedIns named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned The MergerInterests of LinkedIns Directors and Executive Officers in the MergerGolden Parachute Compensation in LinkedIns proxy statement for the special meeting.
 
Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and, as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on LinkedIn, the LinkedIn Board or Microsoft.  Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.  Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
 
The LinkedIn Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
 
The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement.  The descriptions of the merger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.  We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you.  The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
 
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by LinkedIn, Microsoft and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Microsoft and Merger Sub by LinkedIn in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between LinkedIn, Microsoft and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.  LinkedIn stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of LinkedIn, Microsoft or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement.  In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of LinkedIn, Microsoft and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public.  The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding LinkedIn, Microsoft, Merger Sub or their respective businesses.  Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding LinkedIn and our business.
 
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
 
The closing of the merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned The Merger AgreementConditions to the Closing of the Merger), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions, or such other time agreed to in writing by Microsoft, LinkedIn and Merger Sub.  Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL.  The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger, or at such later time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.
 
Effects of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers
 
The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into LinkedIn and LinkedIn will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft; and (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will

Table of Contents
 
cease.  From and after the effective time of the merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of LinkedIn and Merger Sub will vest in the surviving corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of LinkedIn and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the surviving corporation.
 
At the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of LinkedIn as the surviving corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety in the form attached to the merger agreement, and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will become the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended.
 
The parties will take all necessary action to ensure that, effective as of, and immediately following, the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will consist of the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The parties will take all necessary action to ensure that at the effective time of the merger, the officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the officers of the surviving corporation, until their successors are duly appointed.
 
Conversion of Shares
 
Common Stock
 
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (collectively referred to as common stock) (other than shares held by (1) LinkedIn as treasury stock; (2) Microsoft, Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries; and (3) LinkedIn stockholders who have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration (which is $196.00 per share, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes).
 
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock held by (1) LinkedIn or (2) Microsoft, Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
 
Equity Awards; ESPP
 
The merger agreement provides that LinkedIns equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:
 
Stock Options
 
Each surrendered company option will, as of the effective time of the merger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $196.00 for each share of LinkedIn common stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such surrendered company option prior to the effective time of the merger less the applicable exercise price for each such share of LinkedIn common stock under such surrendered company option and less any applicable withholding taxes.  If the per share exercise price of any surrendered company option is equal to or greater than $196.00, such surrendered company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the merger for no payment and will have no further effect.
 
Each assumed company option will, as of the effective time of the merger, be, as determined by Microsoft, (1) assumed by Microsoft and converted into an option to acquire; or (2) converted into an option granted pursuant to the Microsoft stock plan to acquire, in each case on the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such assumed company option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, a number of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (1) the number of shares of LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company option as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (2) the
 
86





Table of Contents
 
stock award exchange ratio.  The per share exercise price for assumed company options will equal the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing (1) the per share exercise price for the LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company option as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by (2) the stock award exchange ratio.  Each company option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than $196.00 and is not a surrendered company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the merger for no payment and will have no further effect.
 
Prior to the closing date of the merger, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all company options that would otherwise be assumed company options as vested surrendered company options, which will become fully vested and then cancelled and treated in accordance with the above.
 
Stock-Based Awards
 
Each surrendered company stock-based award will, as of the effective time of the merger, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $196.00 with respect to each share of LinkedIn common stock subject to the surrendered company stock-based award, less any applicable withholding taxes.
 
Each assumed company stock-based award will, as of the effective time of the merger, be, as determined by Microsoft, (1) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award; or (2) converted into a stock-based award granted pursuant to the Microsoft stock plan, in each case with the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such assumed company stock-based award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, in respect of a number of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (1) the number of shares of LinkedIn common stock subject to such assumed company stock-based award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (2) the stock award exchange ratio.
 
Prior to the closing date of the merger, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all company stock-based awards that would otherwise be assumed company stock-based awards as vested surrendered company stock-based awards, which will become fully vested and then cancelled and treated as a surrendered company stock-based award.
 
ESPP
 
LinkedIns executive officers will determine the final exercise date for purposes of the ESPP.  On such exercise date, LinkedIn will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of LinkedIn common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.  Subject to the consummation of the merger, the ESPP will terminate immediately prior to and effective as of the effective time of the merger.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the LinkedIn Board has adopted resolutions providing that each individual participating in the ESPP now will not be permitted to increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when that offering period commenced, and that each individual participating in the ESPP now or in any future offering period will not be permitted to make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement, except as may be required by applicable law.  Prior to the effective time of the merger, LinkedIn will take all actions that may be necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause any offering period that would otherwise be outstanding at the effective time of the merger to be terminated no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs; (2) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period while treating the shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes of the ESPP; (3) cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (4) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the effective time of the merger.

Exchange and Payment Procedures
 
Prior to the closing of the merger, Microsoft will designate a bank or trust company, which we refer to as the paying agent, to make payments of the merger consideration to LinkedIn stockholders.  At or promptly following the effective time of the merger, Microsoft will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate per share merger consideration to LinkedIn stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement.
 
As soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send to each holder of record of shares of common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the per share merger consideration.  Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with any required bond) or a customary agents message with respect to book-entry shares representing the shares of common stock; and (2) a signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration in exchange therefor, without interest.  The amount of any per share merger consideration paid to LinkedIn stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
 
If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the merger, such cash will be returned to Microsoft, upon demand, and any stockholders who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Microsoft for satisfaction of their claims for payment.  None of Microsoft, Merger Sub, LinkedIn, the surviving corporation or the paying agent will be liable to any LinkedIn stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.
 
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been stolen or destroyed.  In the event that any certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration, Microsoft or the paying agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the merger consideration, require such stockholder to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction, and to deliver a bond in such amount as Microsoft or the paying agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Microsoft, the surviving corporation or the paying agent with respect to such certificate.
 
Representations and Warranties
 
The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of LinkedIn, Microsoft and Merger Sub.
 
Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by LinkedIn are qualified as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect.  For purposes of the merger agreement, Company Material Adverse Effect means, with respect to LinkedIn, any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, effect or circumstance that, individually or taken together with all other changes, events, violations, inaccuracies, effects or circumstances that have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse Effect, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of LinkedIn and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that, none of the following (by itself or when aggregated) to the extent occurring after the date of the merger agreement will be deemed to be or constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will be taken into account when determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur:
 
·                  changes in general economic conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world, or changes in conditions in the global economy generally (except to the extent that such conditions disproportionately affect LinkedIn relative to other companies operating in the industries in which LinkedIn and its subsidiaries conduct business);

negotiations with and terminate any data room or other diligence access of any person, its affiliates and its representatives relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined below) and to request any person who executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring LinkedIn to promptly return or destroy any non-public information furnished by or on behalf of LinkedIn prior to the date of the merger agreement.
 
Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, LinkedIn has agreed, and to cause or direct, as the case may be, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives, not to:

Table of Contents
 
·                  take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a stop, look and listen communication by the LinkedIn Board (or a committee thereof) to LinkedIns stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the LinkedIn Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until the close of business on the 10th business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being considered a violation of the merger agreement); or
 
·                  fail to include the LinkedIn Boards recommendation in this proxy statement.
 
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by stockholders, the LinkedIn Board may, upon compliance with the procedures described below, effect a company board recommendation change if (1) other than in connection with a bona fide acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, there has been an intervening event (as defined below); or (2) LinkedIn has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the LinkedIn Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, in each case, if the LinkedIn Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that a failure to effect a company board recommendation change would be inconsistent with the LinkedIn Boards fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
 
The LinkedIn Board may effect a company board recommendation change, but may not terminate the merger agreement, in response to an intervening event if and only if:
 
·                  LinkedIn has provided prior written notice to Microsoft at least three business days in advance to the effect that the LinkedIn Board has (1) made the determination described above; and (2) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change pursuant to merger agreement, which notice must describe the applicable intervening event in reasonable detail; and
 
·                  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, LinkedIn and its representatives, during such three business day period, must have (1) negotiated with Microsoft and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Microsoft desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the LinkedIn Board no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in response to such intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and (2) permitted Microsoft and its representatives to make a presentation to the LinkedIn Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Microsoft requests to make such a presentation).
 
In addition, the LinkedIn Board may effect a company board recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement in response to a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the LinkedIn Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal if and only if:
 
·                  the LinkedIn Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
 
·                  LinkedIn has complied with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal;
 
·                  LinkedIn has provided prior written notice to Microsoft at least three business days in advance to the effect that the LinkedIn Board has (1) received a bona fide written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement, which
 
96





Table of Contents
 
notice will describe the basis for such company board recommendation change or termination, including the identity of the person or group of persons making such acquisition proposal, the material terms of such acquisition proposal and copies of all relevant documents relating to such acquisition proposal; and
 
·                  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination, LinkedIn and its representatives, during the three business day notice period described above, have (1) negotiated with Microsoft and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Microsoft desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; and (2) permitted Microsoft and its representatives to make a presentation to the LinkedIn Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Microsoft requests to make such a presentation).
 
In the event of any material revision to any such bona fide written acquisition proposal described above, LinkedIn has also agreed to deliver a new notice to Microsoft and comply with the above procedures with respect to such new written notice (with the notice period being two business days) and prior to effecting a company board recommendation change or terminating the merger agreement, at the end of the relevant notice period, the LinkedIn Board must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide written acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.
 
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, an intervening event means any positive change, effect, development, circumstance, condition, event or occurrence that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known to the LinkedIn Board, or the consequences of which (based on facts known to the members of the LinkedIn Board as of the date of the merger agreement) were not reasonably foreseeable as of the date of the merger agreement; and (2) does not relate to any acquisition proposal.
 
Stockholder Meeting
 
LinkedIn has agreed to take all necessary action to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the special meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable and on or around the 20th business day following the commencement of the mailing of this proxy statement for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the merger agreement. LinkedIn is permitted to postpone or adjourn the special meeting in certain circumstances related to soliciting additional proxies or requirements of applicable law.
 
Employee Benefits
 
From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) honor all of LinkedIns benefit plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.  The surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the effective time of the merger by taking such actions, if any, as are required by applicable law.  For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) provide continuing employees with compensation, benefits, and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based compensation and individual employment agreements, except as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph) at levels that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits, and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based compensation and individual employment agreements) provided to continuing employees immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, either through (1) LinkedIns benefit plans and arrangements in existence immediately prior to the effective time of the merger; (2) comparable plans, or some combination of (1) and (2).  In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year following the effective time of the merger for any continuing employee employed during that period except in the ordinary course of business consistent with LinkedIns past practice.  Additionally, for continuing employees who terminate employment during the one year period following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and
 
97





Table of Contents
 
Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) provide severance payments and benefits to eligible employees in accordance with LinkedIns severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of the merger agreement.
 
To the extent that a LinkedIn benefit plan or comparable plan is made available to a continuing employee after the effective time of the merger (other than with respect to certain exceptions), the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) grant continuing employees credit for all service with LinkedIn and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare plan), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits.  In addition, (1) each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such new benefit plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement that the continuing employee participates in immediately before the effective time of the merger; (2) for purposes of each new benefit plan providing health and welfare benefits to a continuing employee, the surviving corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such new benefit plans to be waived for such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement, and the surviving corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement ending on the date that such continuing employees participation in the corresponding new benefit plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such new benefit plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new benefit plan, to the extent credited under the LinkedIn benefit plan or arrangement; and (3) credit the accounts of such continuing employees pursuant to any new benefit plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee.  Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing employee following the effective time of the merger in accordance with LinkedIns vacation or paid time off policies in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
 
Efforts to Close the Merger
 
Under the merger agreement, Microsoft, Merger Sub and LinkedIn agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and assist and cooperate with the other parties, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger and effect the other contemplated transactions thereunder, including using their reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to closing the merger described below to be satisfied, comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger and effect the other contemplated transactions thereunder and seek to obtain any required consents under LinkedIns contracts.
 
Additionally, under the merger agreement, if and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Merger Sub and, solely to the extent requested by Microsoft, LinkedIn, agreed to (1) offer and effect the divestiture or other disposition of any capital stock or assets of LinkedIn; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceeding challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft is not obligated to take any action with respect to LinkedIn that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to LinkedIns business or to take any action with respect to Microsofts business if taking such action would reasonably be expected to (1) have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft; or (2) have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its subsidiaries.
 
Indemnification and Insurance
 
The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) honor and fulfill the obligations of LinkedIn pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
 
98





Table of Contents
 
LinkedIn, on the one hand, and the current or former directors, officers or employees of LinkedIn, on the other hand, that are set forth in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement.
 
In addition, the merger agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each current or former director, officer or employee of LinkedIn or its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from and against all costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of LinkedIn or its subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by LinkedIn, Microsoft or Merger Sub with respect thereto. The merger agreement also provides that the surviving corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by any such indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding.
 
In addition, without limiting the foregoing, unless LinkedIn has purchased a tail policy prior to the effective time of the merger (which LinkedIn may purchase, provided that the premium for such insurance does not exceed 250% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid), the merger agreement requires Microsoft to cause the surviving corporation to maintain, on terms no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, LinkedIns directors and officers insurance policies for a period of at least six years commencing at the effective time of the merger. Neither Microsoft nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay premiums for such policy to the extent such premiums exceed, on an annual basis, 250% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by LinkedIn, and if the premium for such insurance coverage would exceed such amount Microsoft shall be obligated to cause the surviving corporation to obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.
 
The merger agreement also provides that the indemnified parties are third party beneficiaries of the indemnification and insurance provisions in the merger agreement and are entitled to enforce such provisions.

LinkedIn will (1) provide Microsoft with prompt notice of all stockholder litigation relating to the merger agreement; (2) keep Microsoft reasonably informed with respect to status thereof; (3) give Microsoft the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any such litigation; and (4) will consult with Microsoft with respect to the defense, settlement or prosecution of any such litigation and will consider in good faith Microsofts advice with respect to such litigation. LinkedIn may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement, or agree to do any of the foregoing, regarding any such litigation without Microsofts prior written consent.

Termination of the Merger Agreement
 
The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the adoption of the merger agreement by LinkedIn stockholders, in the following ways:
 
·                  by mutual written agreement of LinkedIn and Microsoft;
 
·                  by either LinkedIn or Microsoft if:
 
·                  (1) a permanent injunction or similar order issued by a court or other legal restraint prohibiting consummation of the merger is in effect, or any action taken by a governmental authority prohibiting the merger has become final and non-appealable; or (2) any statute, regulation or order prohibiting the merger has been enacted (except that a party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party has failed to use its reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent pursuant to, resolve or lift, as applicable, such injunction, law or order);
 
·                  the merger has not been consummated before 11:59 pm Pacific time on January  11, 2017, which we refer to as the termination date, except that if all conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the time of closing of the merger) or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) by that date but on that date any of the antitrust or competition-related conditions or the conditions related to prohibitive laws or orders set forth in the merger agreement have not been satisfied, then either LinkedIn or Microsoft may elect to extend the termination date to 11:59 pm Pacific time on  June 11, 2017, but:
 
·                  a party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such partys action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and is the primary cause of the failure to consummate the merger by the termination date; and
 
·                  LinkedIn may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if it has not taken a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting;
 
·                  the LinkedIn stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting (except that a party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such partys action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and is the primary cause of the failure to obtain the approval of the LinkedIn stockholders at the special meeting);

·                  by LinkedIn if:
 
·                  after a cure period, Microsoft or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied;
 
·                  prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LinkedIn stockholders, (1) LinkedIn has received a superior proposal; (2) the LinkedIn Board has authorized LinkedIn to enter into an agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated by such superior proposal; (3) LinkedIn pays Microsoft a $725 million termination fee; and (4) LinkedIn has complied with its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement;
 
·                  by Microsoft if:
 
·                  after a cure period, LinkedIn has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied; or
 
·                  the LinkedIn Board has effected a company board recommendation change.
 
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the merger agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any party to the other parties (or their representatives), as applicable, except certain sections of the merger agreement will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective terms, including terms relating to termination fees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the merger agreement will relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement.  In addition, no termination of the merger agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement between Microsoft and LinkedIn, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective terms.
 
Termination Fee
 
If the merger agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, LinkedIn has agreed to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $725 million.
 
Microsoft will be entitled to receive the termination fee from LinkedIn if the merger agreement is terminated:
 
·                  (1) by Microsoft because LinkedIn has materially breached its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger agreement; (2) following the date of the merger agreement and prior to its termination, an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise received by LinkedIn; and (3) LinkedIn enters into an agreement relating to, or consummates, an acquisition transaction within one year of the termination of the merger agreement (provided that, for purposes of the termination fee, all references to 15% in the definition of acquisition transaction are deemed to be references to 50%);
 
·                  by Microsoft, because the LinkedIn Board has effected a company board recommendation change;
 
·                  by either Microsoft or LinkedIn because the LinkedIn stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement; or
 
·                  by LinkedIn, to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
 
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of June 15, 2016 as to (1) each person who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of any class of our outstanding common stock; (2) each of the named executive officers; (3) each director; and (4) all directors and executive officers as a group.  Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each listed stockholder is c/o LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043.
 
Applicable percentage ownership is based on 119,154,625 shares of Class A common stock and 15,559,383 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at June 15, 2016.  In computing the number of shares of stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of June 15, 2016, and shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units within 60 days of June 15, 2016.  However, we did not deem these shares to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

(a)           Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:
 
(i)    each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;
 
(ii)   each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
 
A-21

(collectively, the Owned Company Shares) will be cancelled without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor; and
 
(iii)  each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
 
(b)           Statutory Rights of Appraisal.
 
(i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who have neither voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the Dissenting Company Shares) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.
 
(ii)   The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.
 
2.8          Equity Awards.
 
(a)           Surrendered Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is (i) vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) listed on Section 2.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a Surrendered Company Option), will, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Surrendered Company Option prior to the Effective Time less the applicable exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock under such Surrendered Company Option and any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with Section
 
A-22





Table of Contents
 
2.12. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price per share under any Surrendered Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Surrendered Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect.
 
(b)           Assumed Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, has an exercise price per share that is less than the Merger Consideration and is not a Surrendered Company Option (each, an Assumed Company Option), will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined by Parent, (x) assumed by Parent and converted into an option to acquire, or (y) converted into an option granted pursuant to Parents 2001 Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the Parent Stock Plan), to acquire, in each case, on the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the terms of such Assumed Company Option not being economically detrimental to the holder thereof and no adverse change to the vesting schedule and with other terms and conditions relating to  method and manner of payment and exercise, and post-termination exercise periods, to the extent administratively practicable, to be no less favorable, it being understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a change in control for purposes of the Company Stock Plans and award agreements thereunder), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (A) the per share exercise price for the Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. As a result of any such conversion provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed Company Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan and grant agreements for the Assumed Company Options (rather than the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under which the Assumed Company Options were originally issued), subject to the foregoing sentence. The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Assumed Company Option will be determined in a manner consistent with the preceding and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, to the extent applicable, Section 424 of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may elect to treat some or all Company Options that would otherwise be Assumed Company Options as vested Surrendered Company Options, which will be settled in accordance with Section 2.8(a), with the vesting of such Company Options fully accelerated prior to such treatment. Each  Company Option that is (x) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration and (z) is not a Surrendered Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect.
 
(c)           Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) is listed on Section 2.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the occurrence of vesting or the Effective Time (each, a Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award), will, as of the Effective Time, be

deemed to be vested and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to the Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award, less any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with Section 2.12.
 
(d)           Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award (each, an Assumed Company Stock-Based Award), will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined by Parent, (x) assumed by Parent and converted into a stock-based award or (y) converted into a stock-based award granted pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan, in each case, with the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such Assumed Company Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (with no adverse change to the vesting terms and with other terms and conditions, including relating to satisfaction of tax withholding obligations, to the extent administratively practicable to be no less favorable, it being understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a change in control for purposes of the Company Stock Plans and award agreements thereunder), in respect of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Stock-Based Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. As a result of any such conversion provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan and grant agreements for the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards (rather than the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under which the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards were originally issued), subject to the foregoing sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may elect to treat some or all Company Stock-Based Awards that would otherwise be Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards as vested Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards, which will be settled in accordance with Section 2.8(c), but the vesting of such Company Stock-Based Awards will be fully accelerated prior to such treatment, except that the applicable settlement date may be delayed to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code.
 
(e)           Parent Actions Related to Assumed Awards. Parent will take such actions as are reasonably necessary, if any, to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), to the extent the Assumed  Company Options and Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards are not already registered by Parent under the Securities Act, Parent will cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. Parent will use the same level of efforts that it uses to maintain the effectiveness of its other registration statements on Form S-8 to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any Assumed Company Options or Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.

(f)            Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, will adopt any resolutions and take any actions within its authority with respect to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder as are reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8, including (i) providing notice to each holder of a Company Option or Company Stock-Based Award in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent of the treatment of the Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) satisfying all applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company will provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon (and Parents review and delivery of comments will occur promptly after the Company provides Parent with such drafts and the Companys acceptance of Parents reasonable comments will not be unreasonably withheld), all notices, resolutions and other written actions or communications as may be required to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.8.
 
(g)           Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate amount owed to holders of Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than four Business Days following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Surrendered Company Options or Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(c), as applicable. All such payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Surrendered Company Options or Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(c), as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter). All such payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes.
 
(h)           Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Companys 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to provide that each individual participating in the Offering Period (as defined in  the ESPP) in progress on the date of this Agreement or, solely with respect to clause (ii), that commences after the date of this Agreement, but before the Effective Time, will not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when that Offering Period commenced; or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any Offering Period that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time to be terminated no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
 
A-25

shortened Offering Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Offering Period as a fully effective and completed Offering Period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no further Offering Period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the Effective Time. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.
 
2.9          Surrender of Shares.
 
(a)           Paying Agent and Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into a customary agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company with a paying agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the Paying Agent) for the payment of the per share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.7(a)(iii). At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments in respect of Company Common Stock under Section 2.7(a)(iii) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the Exchange Fund) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares.  The Paying Agent will deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 2.7 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.7, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.
 
(b)           Exchange Procedures.
 
(i)    Certificates. Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than two Business Days thereafter), to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares (as defined below) or a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) (the Certificates) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, receipt by the Paying Agent of an agents message in customary form or such other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate, and
 
A-26






Table of Contents
 
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, in respect of such Certificate the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to pursuant to Section 2.7. The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.
 
(ii)   Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (Book-Entry Shares) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will upon receipt of an agents message in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an agents message or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time be entitled to receive for the number of Book-Entry Shares, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of such Book-Entry Shares the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to pursuant to Section 2.7. The Book-Entry Shares of such holder will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.
 
(c)           Investment of Exchange Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Exchange Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). No losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.  Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
 
(d)           Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-

Entry Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.
 
(e)           No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
 
(f)            Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.
 
2.10        No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(b). The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
 
2.11        Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or

destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
2.12        Required Withholding. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options such amounts as will be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld they will be (a) paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority for crediting to the account of the Person from whom such amounts were withheld, and (b)  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
 
2.13        Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.
 
2.14        Adjustment to Merger Consideration.  If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock occurs as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, or any record date for any such purpose is established, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement will be appropriately adjusted.

With respect to any Section of this Article III, except (a) as disclosed in the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act on or after January 1, 2015, and prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of information, factors or  risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the Company Recent SEC Reports) (it being understood that (i) any matter disclosed in any Company Recent SEC Report will be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such disclosure in such Company Recent SEC Report that it is applicable to such section of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) this clause (a) will not apply to any of Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.7 and the second sentence of Section 3.12(a)); or (b) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1          Organization; Good Standing. The Company (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties, rights and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties, rights and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of good standing is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the Charter) and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the Bylaws), each as amended to date. The Charter and Bylaws are in full force and effect on the date of this Agreement.  The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.
 
3.2          Corporate Power; Enforceability. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform its covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and (B) is subject to general principles of equity.
 
3.3          Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws.
 
(a)           Company Board Approval. The Company Board has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth herein; (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the Company Board Recommendation).
 
(b)           Fairness Opinion. The Company Board has received the written opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of its financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP (the Advisor), to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the
 
A-30





Table of Contents
 
various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock, in their capacity as holders of Company Class A Common Stock (other than Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, if applicable), pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such written opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub). Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company will deliver a copy of such opinion to Parent for information purposes only.
 
(c)           Anti-Takeover Laws. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable anti-takeover Law will not be applicable to this Agreement or the Merger.  No other fair price, moratorium, control share acquisition or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under any Laws applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is applicable to this Agreement or the Merger.
 
3.4          Requisite Stockholder Approval.

the properties, books and records, facilities and personnel and Representatives of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information so long as the Company has taken all reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information and to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by Parent and its Representatives based on such information on a basis that does not compromise the Companys attorney-client or other privilege with respect thereto; or (c) access to a Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract.  Subject to applicable Law, the Company will provide Parent with reports of the Company reasonably requested by Parent. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.6 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing.

In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving

Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter and the Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.
 
(b)           Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.8(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements set forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter with the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto, except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel

will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
 
(c)           D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (D&O Insurance) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth on Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (such 250% amount, the Maximum Annual Premium). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Company may (or if Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid tail policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such tail policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases such a tail policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such tail policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such tail policy is in full force and effect.
 
(d)           Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.
 
(e)           No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.8 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the tail policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the tail policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the tail policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.8 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws;

(f)            Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

(a)           Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a change of control (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.
 
(b)           Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Employee Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, but subject to Section 6.9(c), nothing will require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to continue any Employee Plan, Company Plan or Comparable Plan or prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time by taking such actions, if any, as are required by applicable Law. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans (other than equity-based benefits, including for all purposes of this  Section 6.9(c) under the ESPP, and, subject to Section 6.9(b), individual employment agreements) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the Company Plans) at benefit levels that are, in the aggregate, no less than those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits (including for all purposes of this Section 6.9(c), vacation and paid time off benefits) to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.9(b), individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (Comparable Plans); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable

Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.9(b), individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period except in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Companys past practice. For Continuing Employees who terminate employment during the one-year period following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance payments and benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the Companys severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
 
(d)           New Plans.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the New Plans) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the Old Plans); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent waived under  the corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, to the extent credited under the corresponding Old Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee.

(b)           Specific Performance.
 
(i)            The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) they will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (B) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
 
(ii)           The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

9.10        Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Merger; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement or the Merger will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Merger in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any

Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
 
9.11        WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.
 
9.12        Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an Electronic Delivery), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
 
9.13        No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will (except to the extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

Mountain View, CA 94043
 
Members of the Board:
 
We understand that LinkedIn Corporation (the Company), Microsoft Corporation (Parent) and Liberty Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub), has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 11, 2016 (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the Merger).  Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will continue as the surviving corporation, and each outstanding share of Class A common stock par value $0.0001 of the Company (Company Class A Common Stock) and Class B common stock par value $0.0001 of the Company (Company Class B Common Stock), other than shares held by the Company as treasury stock, held by Parent or Merger Sub, held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or any Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $196.00 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock, in their capacity as holders of Company Class A Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the Holders), pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.
 
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company.  We have also reviewed certain forward looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial projections and operating data prepared by the management of the Company (the Company Projections).  Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the Company.  We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Class A Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Class A Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities.  In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
 
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company.  With respect to the Company Projections we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters

covered thereby. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay.  In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.  In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
 
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services payable upon rendering of this opinion.  We will also receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated.  In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.  During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst and its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst or its affiliates; however Qatalyst and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company and Parent and their respective affiliates for which we or they would expect to receive compensation.
 
Qatalyst provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of corporations and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise.  In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
 
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice.  This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent.  This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices at which Company Class A Common Stock will trade at any time.
 
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof.  Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.  Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company.  Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in their capacity as such Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Companys officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to such Merger Consideration. We also express no opinion regarding the consideration to be received by any holder of Company Class B Common Stock under the Merger Agreement in such holders capacity as a holder of Company Class B Common Stock.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in their capacity as such Holders, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

Annex C
 
SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
 
§262. Appraisal rights.
 
(a)    Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to §228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholders shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word stockholder means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words stock and share mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words depository receipt mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.
 
(b)    Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to §251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to §251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, §251(h) of this title), §252, §254, §255, §256, §257, §258, §263 or §264 of this title:
 
(1)    Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in §363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §251(f) of this title.
 
(2)    Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
 
a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;
 
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
 
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2) a. and b. of this section; or
 
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2) a., b. and c. of this section.
 
(3)    In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §251(h), §253 or §267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
 
(4)    In the event of an amendment to a corporations certificate of incorporation contemplated by §363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by §363(b) of this title, and the
 
C-1

procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word amendment substituted for the words merger or consolidation, and the word corporation substituted for the words constituent corporation and/or surviving or resulting corporation.
 
(c)    Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
 
(d)    Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
 
(1)    If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholders shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholders shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholders shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or
 
(2)    If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253, or §267  of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holders shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holders shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within

10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holders shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
 
(e)    Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholders demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholders written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such persons own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
 
(f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
 
(g)    At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the

appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
 
(h)    After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholders certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
 
(i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Courts decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.
 
(j)     The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
 
(k)    From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholders demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholders demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
 
(l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
