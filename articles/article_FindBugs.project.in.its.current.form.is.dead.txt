       Hi all,

TL;DR: I'm really sorry to say, but FindBugs project in its current form 
is dead.

Longer explanation follows.

Current project setup is:

1) On the plus side, we have two committers with push rights to the 
github repo, however one from this two (Tagir) is not active anymore for 
the project and second one (me) has no free time to work on the project. 
That's however all about the good things...

2) Only the project leader Bill Pugh has admin rights for the project 
web page and the github project group and page. We cannot deploy any 
website update, we can't add new project members, we can't manage code 
access rights, we can't publish releases to the well known update sites 
without his help. Without him, we have no admin rights to anything, we 
can only push to the repository.

3) It looks like Bill Pugh is not interested in the FindBugs project 
anymore, and we can't reach them. I say "it looks like" because we 
requested his help for the project many times (via direct mails, 
postings to the list and to the github issues) but haven't received any 
sign of life from him since a year. We know that he is active elsewhere 
(https://twitter.com/wpugh). A week ago I've sent another mail to Bill 
(and CC to the findbugs-core at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list) asking 
him about the current project state - with no answer so far. You can 
read my mail in the attachment. IMHO no answer to this mail was the 
answer enough. Either Bill has completely lost access to his old mail 
account (which is possible too) or he is ignoring me or the project 
(which is more likely).

If someone has a possibility to contact him in some way 
(twitter/mail/phone/whatever) and point him to the discussion on this 
list - please do so!

Without Bill Pugh FindBugs project is headless and effectively *finally* 
dead. It is not the *only* reason for the project to be dead, but a 
bigger one, and the last one.

The other major reasons for the FindBugs current bad state:

1) The code is very complex, has "organically grown" over a decade, is 
not documented and has poor public interfaces. Most of the code consists 
of the very low level bytecode related stuff, tightly coupled with the 
ancient BCEL library, which doesn't scale and is not multi-thread safe. 
No one enjoys maintaining this code, at least not me. I see no future 
for FindBugs with the BCEL approach, and see no way to get rid of it 
without investing lot of effort, and without breaking every detector and 
possibly many 3rd party tools. This is the biggest issue we have with 
FindBugs today, and most likely the root cause for all the evil. This 
code can't be fixed, it must be rewritten.

2) Because the code is as it is, there are not so many people willing to 
contribute. We see some pull requests on github, but most of them are 
smaller fixes or enhancements (many thanks to you guys, and sorry I have 
no time to review and test all of them!). Those who were willing and 
able to contribute leaved the project one by one. At last, we had Tagir 
contributed lot of things (many thanks!), but since he left us for his 
own project (https://github.com/amaembo/huntbugs) we saw no major code 
contributions anymore. BTW the fact that he left the project is also a 
sign that the project is in a very bad shape - it was easier for him to 
write the code from scratch as to continue supporting FindBugs. 
Currently I'm the last committer left on the project, and I'm not really 
active because lack of the free time. We clearly failed to build a 
contributors community.

3) We have *zero* support from organizations. There are no companies 
investing into the project in any way (neither via code patches or 
testing, nor via spending developers time for the project), although I 
know there are companies using FindBugs in their commercial products, 
for example SonarSource and Coverity, and of course there are many 
companies and projects just using FindBugs in their build processes.

Add to this the project leader ignoring all communication with the 
project and you will agree with me that FindBugs today is a headless 
"zombie" project without future.

However, FindBugs is still useful, even in its current state, and it 
will be sad to throw it away just because it can't evolve as we all 
would like.

So what do we need to keep it alive?

1) We must be able to update the project site and to point all links to 
github. This is needed because many people still use old sourceforge 
tracker to report bugs or enhancements, and github made contributions 
and communication much easier for everyone.

2) We must be able to shut down the old sourceforge bug tracker and 
forums and point all links to github.

3) We must be able to grant access rights to the github project for 
those who can and will contribute.

4) We must be able to publish the new releases to the well known 
download sites or at least point the project webpage to the github 
releases page (https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/releases).

5) We should configure automated build and test (for example via 
TravisCI as suggested via 
https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/pull/48). Without this it is 
hard to review pull requests, because manual build and test requires lot 
of time.

6) We need more people contributing, testing and reviewing patches. We 
have currently 15 open pull requests, and it would be nice if they were 
reviewed and tested.

What can we do, and which alternatives do we have:

1) As one can see, we can't do points 1-5 without Bill. If someone 
somehow manages to contact Bill (twiter/mail/phone/whatever) - please do 
that and get a clear statement from him what he as a project leader 
plans to do to solve the points above. As far as I can understand it 
(looking on Bill public activities), he has no will to spend any time on 
project problems because they don't really hurt him. A possible solution 
here would be to find some person to whom Bill have give the admin 
rights, so that we can solve points 1-5 without requesting time from 
Bill. Unfortunately, from my personal experience so far (after many 
years on the project) I believe that Bill still doesn't trust me 
(because I'm from Russia and Russia is evil), so it is very unlikely 
that he will give me admin rights. This is sad, but this is something I 
can't influence in any way. At least I'm happy to know that Eclipse 
projects I'm contributing to *do* trust me (JGit, EGit, Platform UI).

2) If someone wants to fork FindBugs, this could be a way to go, but 
this should be the last resort from my point of view. A fork is the 
worst thing we can do, but probably better as the dead project anyway. 
My personal advice would be - don't do it, but start your own project, 
without legacy code, or join Tagir on his HuntBugs project: 
https://github.com/amaembo/huntbugs, or join any other project in the 
universe suitable to analyze Java code.

3) Without active committers and without changes in the code base 
FindBugs will become more and more irrelevant. FindBugs will not support 
lambda's, type annotations and any new Java 8+ language features without 
major changes in the project state. No serious code contribution is 
possible with the current setup, because I'm alone and definitely can't 
spend so much time for the project. I will keep the FindBugs and Eclipse 
plugin running until there will be a better (open source) alternative 
with Ant and Eclipse support. I will be happy to name you a comparable 
alternative today, but I don't see any yet. I hope HuntBugs could be 
such alternative, but it is not yet there.

That's basically all what I wanted to say for a long time about the 
FindBugs project state, and sorry for the long mail.
