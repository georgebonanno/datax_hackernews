  1.1.0

    Today I’d like to announce Homebrew 1.1.0. We’ve had a great response to Homebrew 1.0.0 and been iterating on our work there. That 1.1.0 follows 1.0.9 is a happy coincidence due to breaking changes; in the future we may have a e.g. 1.1.10.

1.1.0 contains some breaking changes:

Disable SHA-1 checksum support in formulae
  Disable running Homebrew as the root user  (e.g. sudo brew)
  Bottles with _or_later tags no longer use _or_later in their filenames so the existing bottle can be reused
Some of the changes since 1.0.0 I’d like to highlight are the following:

A branch named stable (rather than master) is used for following Homebrew/brew tags
  brew test-bot has moved to its own tap
  brew info now also lists Requirements (e.g. depends_on :foo) as well as dependencies
  Rubocop configured so Rubocop-supporting editors get the correct messaging for editing files in Homebrew/brew and Library/Taps
  External brew commands can now use #: comments to automatically have rich --help output
  The brew.1 manpage points to official external commands (brew bundle, brew cask, brew services)
  OS X Mavericks (10.9) and above now use BSD tar’s libarchive LZMA support rather than needing to install xz 
  A brew tap-new command is available for creating a new tap with a README and preconfigured Travis CI file (.travis.yml)
  Bottle/binary package creation and extraction has been sped up
  brew output has been improved when git is not installed
  A new brew cask reinstall command was added
  brew info now lists required option builds in dependencies output
Enjoy using Homebrew!

            var range = document.createRange();
            range.selectNode(elem);
            window.getSelection().addRange(range);
        }
      }

      function loadLanguage(lang) {
        if (lang === null) {
            return;
        } else if (lang === "en") {
            window.location.replace("/");
        } else {
            window.location.replace("/index_" + lang + ".html");
        }
      }
